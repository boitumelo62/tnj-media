            Microsoft Slashes 9,000 Jobs in Major Restructure, Xbox Division
            Hard Hit
          </h2>
          <p>
            Microsoft has announced a sweeping round of layoffs affecting 9,000
            employees, roughly 4% of its global workforce. The cuts mark the
            company's second significant downsizing this year and include major
            impacts across its gaming division, particularly Xbox Game Studios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite reporting strong user engagement in its gaming sector,
            Microsoft has opted to streamline its operations, citing a need to
            reduce management layers and enhance agility. Employees in the Xbox
            division were among the hardest hit, with an estimated 2,000 roles
            eliminated. Internal communications indicated that key projects
            would continue, while affected staff were encouraged to apply for
            other positions within the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several major game projects were cancelled as part of the
            restructuring. These include the long-awaited title Everwild from
            Rare, as well as the reboot of Perfect Dark. The closure of The
            Initiative, the studio behind Perfect Dark, has also been confirmed.
            An unannounced MMORPG from ZeniMax Online Studios was also shelved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The job cuts come amid Microsoft's broader strategic pivot toward
            artificial intelligence. The company has significantly increased its
            investments in AI technologies and infrastructure, planning to spend
            tens of billions of dollars over the next year. Executives have
            stated that AI now contributes a sizable portion of the company's
            internal codebase and product development workflows.
          </p>
          <p>
            This move follows an earlier wave of approximately 6,000 job
            reductions earlier in 2025. While severance packages and support
            services have been offered to affected employees, the layoffs
            reflect growing pressure within the tech industry to cut costs while
            reorienting around AI and cloud computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Microsoft has affirmed that strong-performing teams and projects
            will remain a priority, even as it undergoes this major
            organizational shift.
