                  What Happens When Millions of South Africans Lose Access to
                  Free-to-Air TV?

          <p>
            The state of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has
            been central topic of discussion for many years now. The company
            responsible for bringing forth some of South Africa's most nostalgic
            and groundbreaking shows, has found itself in deep trouble, facing a
            major collapse. Here we discuss the numerous factors that could very
            well be the cause of the dismal situation in which it has found
            itself in.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Collapse of TV Licence Revenue</strong></p>
          <p>
            The rise of streaming services such Amazon Prime and Showmax along
            with the rise of social media (YouTube in particular), has led to a
            decline in the compliance rate with regards to TV License payments.
            This decline has dropped to as low as 14% by 2024. Simply put: South
            Africans simply do not pay their TV licences, and this is due to a
            flawed and outdated system that has led to a sharp drop in one of
            the SABC's key income sources.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Negative effects of Load Shedding</strong></p>
          <p>
            Regular power outages (load shedding) disrupt television and radio
            broadcasting, which inevitably has led to audiences shrinking during
            outages, and severely reducing advertising reach and revenue. It has
            also led to an increase in operational costs such installing backup
            power, along with the fuel costs to operate such machinery which
            causes interrupted workflows and productivity.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Over-reliance on Advertising</strong></p>
          <p>
            As it stands, 80% of SABC's revenue comes from advertising, and this
            model is one that is not sustainable. We all tend to dislike
            adverts, and cand often find them annoying is they are over played,
            and that is what the SABC does. During economic downturns or shifts
            in viewing habits (like people switching to streaming), ad revenue
            suffers. The limited number of high-performing shows also restricts
            ad potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Low Investment in Content</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to financial strain, over 80% of its long-term capital plan has
            been suspended. This includes slashing budgets for added content,
            which makes it harder to attract and retain audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, like the concept of evolution as conceptualized by
            Charles Darwin himself, it is the survival of the fittest. It is
            important for companies to keep track of the dynamic media and tech
            world, to ensure sustainability and longevity.
