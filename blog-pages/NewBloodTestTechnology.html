          <p>
            A groundbreaking new technology is changing how doctors monitor the
            effectiveness of cancer treatments, offering a faster, less invasive
            way to track solid tumor response through simple blood samples.
            Researchers from a team at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts
            General Hospital have unveiled a liquid biopsy method that can
            detect molecular changes in real time, providing critical insights
            into how tumors are responding to therapies without the need for
            repeated imaging or surgical biopsies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technique, known as ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) profiling,
            analyzes fragments of DNA shed by tumors into the bloodstream. By
            examining specific genetic mutations and epigenetic markers, the
            test can identify whether a patient is responding positively to
            treatment—often weeks or even months earlier than conventional scans
            would indicate. This real-time monitoring allows doctors to make
            faster and more accurate decisions about whether to continue,
            change, or stop a therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Alicia Romero, the lead researcher on the study, emphasized the
            potential impact of the technology: “This approach can transform the
            way we treat cancer. By understanding tumor dynamics as they happen,
            we can tailor treatments with unprecedented precision, sparing
            patients from ineffective therapies and toxic side effects.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The test has been shown to be effective across several types of
            solid tumors, including lung, breast, and colorectal cancers. In
            clinical trials involving over 1,000 patients, the blood-based
            monitoring system successfully predicted treatment outcomes with
            over 85% accuracy. Patients whose ctDNA levels dropped significantly
            after initiating therapy showed longer survival rates and improved
            recovery compared to those whose levels remained unchanged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond its diagnostic value, the technology also opens the door for
            personalized medicine. Oncologists can use the blood test to detect
            early signs of resistance to a specific drug and pivot to
            alternative treatments before the cancer has a chance to progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            The innovation comes at a time when cancer care is rapidly evolving,
            with a growing emphasis on targeted therapies and real-time data.
            Experts say this new tool could not only improve outcomes but also
            reduce costs by avoiding ineffective treatments and unnecessary
            procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The FDA is currently reviewing the technology for broader clinical
            approval. If cleared, the blood test could soon become a standard
            part of cancer management protocols across hospitals worldwide. As
            the medical community continues to push for earlier, smarter
            interventions, this advancement marks a significant step toward a
            future where cancer treatment is more responsive, less invasive, and
            deeply personalized.
