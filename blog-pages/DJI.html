          <p>
            Since October 2024, there has been much buzz around a hinted
            360-degree camera from DJI have been swirling since October.
            However, there have been a few fresh leaks that could grant ‘intel’
            about the much-anticipated DJI Osmo 360 camera – as well as hinting
            at the specifications it will bring with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            DJI, short for Dajiang Innovation, is a Chinese company specializing
            in drones, gimbals, and related equipment. They are known for their
            innovative and high-quality consumer and professional-grade
            products, dominating the drone market.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those new to the tech space, a 360-degree camera also called an
            omnidirectional camera, captures a 360-degree view of its
            surroundings. In contrast to traditional cameras that capture a
            limited field of view, 360 cameras use multiple lenses, typically
            fisheye lenses, to record an entire sphere of imagery. This allows
            for immersive, spherical images or videos that viewers can explore
            from any angle. This camera has also led to the boom of the Virtual
            Reality (VR) world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Popular tech geek and tipster @GAtamer (via Notebookcheck) posted
            pictures of the DJI Osmo 360, displaying the compact camera, the two
            lenses on the front and back of the device, the small integrated
            touchscreen, and what looks like an accessory mount.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the same source, the specs of the DJI Osmo 360 are
            going to be &quot;almost the same as the X5&quot;, referring of
            course to the Insta360 X5 that launched in April – another
            360-degree camera that the DJI Osmo 360 will be challenging head on.
          </p>
          <p>
            @GAtamer’s post was a follow-up to another image leaked by
            @Quadro_News, which seems to show the DJI Osmo 360 in some form of
            packaging. Again, we can see one of the camera lenses and the shape
            of the upcoming gadget.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, all we can glean from these latest DJI Osmo 360 leaks, and
            we do not get any information here about a launch date or potential
            pricing. It seems likely that the camera will be appearing sooner
            rather than later. However, it is rumoured that the DJI Osmo 360
            would be launching in July this, news that will be highly welcomed
            by the entire tech community.
