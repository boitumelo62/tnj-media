          <p>
            In an age dominated by terabyte cloud storage, lightning-fast SSDs,
            and AI-generated data, it might come as a surprise that some systems
            around the world are still powered—at least in part—by 3.5-inch
            floppy disks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, the same floppy disks that many thought died out with dial-up
            internet and CRT monitors are still being used in critical
            industries today. While modern tech continues to evolve at a
            breakneck pace, these legacy storage devices continue to quietly
            fulfil roles no other technology has quite managed to replace—yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the aviation world, floppy disks are more than just nostalgia.
            Certain older aircraft, including some models of Boeing 747s and
            early Airbus planes, still use floppy disks to load navigation data
            and update software. These aircraft, many of which are still in
            operation in smaller airlines or cargo fleets, rely on legacy
            systems that were originally designed in the 1980s and 1990s.
          </p>
          <p>
            On factory floors, decades-old machines still operate using embedded
            systems that require floppy disks for data input. In some hospitals
            and labs, older diagnostic equipment also continues to rely on
            floppies, especially in regions where budgets are tight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some government and military systems use floppy disks as a form of
            air-gapped security. Without internet connectivity, these
            low-capacity disks offer a surprising level of protection from
            cyberattacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond industry, floppy disks have found new life among digital
            artists and retro tech fans. Albums, games, and pixel art stored on
            floppy disks are part of a growing niche movement celebrating
            digital minimalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though no longer mass-produced, floppy disks are still available
            through specialty vendors and online sellers. A handful of companies
            even manufacture new disks to meet ongoing demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite their age, floppy disks are still quietly spinning in
            aircraft, factories, and creative spaces—proof that sometimes old
            tech refuses to die.
