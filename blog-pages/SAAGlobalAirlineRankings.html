            South African Airways (SAA) has once again secured a spot among the
            top 100 airlines in the world, moving up to 67th place in the 2025
            Skytrax World Airline Awards.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's a slight but steady improvement from 69th place in 2024 and a
            positive sign of the airline's continued recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            These rankings are based on the world's largest annual airline
            passenger survey, which isn't limited to certain airlines. Anyone
            can vote, and it reflects real customer choices from all over the
            globe. This year's results included over 325 airlines, with the top
            100 published.
          </p>
          <p>
            SAA's steady rise in the rankings comes as the airline works its way
            through a long-term turnaround plan. After years of financial
            trouble and bailouts, made worse by the pandemic in 2020, the
            airline has finally begun to turn a corner. In fact, SAA posted a
            net profit of R252 million for the 2022/23 financial year the first
            profit since 2012.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of its recovery, the airline is focusing on consolidating
            its operations, opening new routes, and improving both service and
            financial stability.Meanwhile, other South African carriers also
            made a mark in the low-cost category. FlySafair was named the best
            low-cost airline in Africa, beating out last year's winner, LIFT.
            Fastjet also made it into the top three in this category.
          </p>
          <p>
            FlySafair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kirby Gordon, said the
            recognition is a testament to the team's hard work. “We've spent
            over a decade committed to providing South Africans with affordable,
            reliable travel and it's great to see that effort recognised
            globally.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In other categories, Airlink claimed the title of the cleanest
            airline in Africa this year, overtaking SAA. Airlink also ranked as
            the best regional airline on the continent. However, when it comes
            to staff service, South African airlines still trail behind some of
            their African peers. SAA ranked 4th in Africa for airline staff,
            followed by Airlink (7th), LIFT (8th), and FlySafair (10th). The top
            spots went to EgyptAir, RwandAir, and Ethiopian Airlines
          </p>
          <p>
            These awards highlight the growing competitiveness of African
            airlines and show that South Africa's carriers are continuing to
            make progress with some already earning recognition on the global
            stage
