            Forget about creating a Zoom, Teams or Google Meet account just to
            chat with someone. This feature connects you to FaceTime calls
            regardless of platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            FaceTime is one of the easiest ways to make a video call on an
            iPhone or Mac as long as the other people on the line also own Apple
            devices -- or so you might think. In fact, it turns out that
            FaceTime calls can be shared among non-Apple folks too, including
            your friends who use Android phones or Windows computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This capability, along with support for Rich Communication Services
            in iOS 18, dispels the idea that Apple's ecosystem is as closed as
            many people think. (RCS adoption doesn't mean the end of blue and
            green bubbles, though.) And unlike many competing video calling
            services, your friends don't need to download a separate app -- all
            they need is a compatible web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is a catch: Android and PC owners can participate in
            FaceTime calls but not initiate them. They need to first be invited
            by someone with an Apple device and then join using a special link.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a step-by-step guide on how to initiate FaceTime calls to
            Android users if you're an iPhone user, and how to receive FaceTime
            calls if you use an Android phone.
          </p>
          <h3>FaceTime: How to video chat on Android or a PC</h3>
          <p>
            As with any call, someone must initiate it. And if you're on an
            Android phone or using a PC, that person is going to have to be
            someone with an iPhone, iPad or Mac.
          </p>
          <h3>Here's how to initiate a FaceTime call on an iPhone or iPad:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><em>1.</em> Open the FaceTime app.</li>
            <li>
              <em>2.</em> Tap Create Link. A screen slides up from the bottom
              that says FaceTime Link.
            </li>
            <li><em>3.</em> Click Add Name to enter a name for your chat.</li>
            <li>
              <em>4.</em> On the same screen, choose an option to share the
              FaceTime link via Messages, Mail, Calendar or other installed
              apps. You can also tap Copy and then paste the link yourself in
              another app you're using, such as WhatsApp.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The process is nearly identical to generating a FaceTime video call
            link from a Mac.
          </p>
          <h3>
            If you're on an Android phone, here's how to join a FaceTime call:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>1.</em>Click the FaceTime call link sent by your Apple-using
              friend.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>2.</em> The link opens in your browser -- you'll need the
              latest version of Chrome or Edge.
            </li>
            <li><em>3.</em> Enter your name and tap Continue.</li>
            <li><em>4.</em> Tap Join.</li>
            <li><em>5.</em> Wait for the host to let you in.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you're on a PC, this process works the same as well.</p>
          <p>
            To start a video call from Android, you'll need an alternative such
            as Google Meet, Zoom or Microsoft Teams. They remain great options
            for video calls between Android and iOS devices.
