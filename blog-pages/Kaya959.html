            Kaya 959 has been leading the pack online, holding the number one
            spot for average daily active users among commercial radio station
            websites in South Africa for five straight months from January to
            May 2025.
          </p>

            Verified audience data shows that
            <a

            </a>
            consistently pulled in more users each day than major competitors
            like Jacaranda FM, East Coast Radio, and platforms under Primedia
            Broadcasting. February marked a high point with over 50,500 users in
            that month alone, and even in other months, the site kept a strong
            pace, averaging just over 46,000 users monthly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, the station took its presence offline and into the
            community with the In Your City Roadshow, held at The Forum in
            Bryanston and at the UCT Graduate Business School in Cape Town, the
            events were done in partnership with Kaya's new sales partner,
            United Stations. At these gatherings, they shared findings from the
            2024 BrandMapp Market Research Survey, which helped solidify Kaya
            959's strong influence in Gauteng's urban market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Managing Director Colleen Louw emphasized the deep trust that Kaya's
            audience has in the station, noting that listeners rely on them for
            music, news, and a sense of companionship. She highlighted that Kaya
            959 reaches the largest black commercial radio audience in greater
            Johannesburg a group that's both highly engaged and valuable to
            advertisers. With their growing digital footprint, Kaya is offering
            more ways than ever to connect whether on air, online, or at events
            in the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The BrandMapp research also revealed several standout insights. For
            one, Kaya dominates the 25-49 age group in Gauteng, with 68% of its
            local audience tuning in daily. Listeners also place a high level of
            trust in FM radio more than TV, social media, or other digital
            platforms when it comes to news. Mobile engagement is rising too,
            with 31% of respondents saying they consume Kaya's content via their
            phones every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the station's pull comes from its popular personalities
            people like Sizwe Dhlomo, Thomas Msengana, Andy Magondwana, Glen
            Lewis, Gugu Mfuphi, and Brenda Sisane, who all keep listeners coming
            back. Social media is another strong suit, with Kaya's audience
            especially active on platforms like LinkedIn, TikTok, and X.
            Musically, Kaya 959 keeps things broad and inclusive, with a mix of
            R&B, soul, gospel, Afro-jazz and more reflecting the depth and
            diversity of its community.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this reinforces what Kaya 959 has become: not just a radio
            station, but a trusted, multi platform brand that speaks
            authentically to its audience.
