            SpaceX's Starship rocket exploded once again during a high-altitude
            test flight on Friday, June 20, 2025, marking another setback in the
            company's push to develop a fully reusable spacecraft capable of
            carrying humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The
            unmanned prototype lifted off from the company's Starbase facility
            in Boca Chica, Texas, soaring into the sky on a test designed to
            evaluate systems critical to future missions. However, minutes into
            the flight, the vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure, erupting
            into flames in a dramatic scene captured by onlookers and
            livestreamed across the world.

            The incident occurred after what initially appeared to be a
            successful launch. The booster stage separated from the upper
            section of the rocket as planned, but something went wrong during
            the spacecraft's return phase. SpaceX confirmed the explosion,
            noting that telemetry was lost shortly before the craft
            disintegrated midair. The exact cause of the failure remains under
            investigation, with Elon Musk's company emphasizing that the test
            was part of a learning process meant to identify and resolve flaws
            in the system.

            Starship is central to NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return
            astronauts to the Moon later this decade. The rocket, standing
            nearly 400 feet tall, is the most powerful ever built and designed
            to be fully reusable. Despite repeated test failures, SpaceX has
            continued to refine the design through a trial-and-error approach
            that has historically yielded rapid advancements in aerospace
            technology. While critics have raised concerns over the risks and
            costs of this aggressive development strategy, SpaceX maintains that
            such tests are essential to achieving long-term success.

            This latest explosion underscores the complexity of building a new
            class of heavy-lift space vehicles. Still, SpaceX remains
            undeterred. In a statement released shortly after the incident, the
            company reiterated its commitment to pushing the boundaries of space
            exploration. Engineers are already analysing flight data to
            understand what went wrong and to prepare for the next test. For
            now, the journey to Mars faces another delay, but in the eyes of
            SpaceX, every explosion is one step closer to liftoff.
