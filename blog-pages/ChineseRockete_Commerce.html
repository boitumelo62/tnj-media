            A Chinese private rocket firm has successfully tested transporting
            packages from Taobao, one of the country's largest e-commerce
            platforms, using a reusable rocket. The rocket was later recovered
            from the sea, marking a significant advancement in commercial space
            logistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            EPOCH, a Beijing-based startup, completed its inaugural "rocket
            delivery" experiment on May 29 when its XZY-1 verification rocket
            carried over 20 kilograms of packages during a test flight off
            China's eastern coast.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 26.8-meter stainless steel rocket, weighing 57 tonnes, flew for
            125 seconds and reached an altitude of 2.5 kilometres before
            successfully landing vertically on the sea surface near Shandong
            Province.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following an 18-hour recovery operation, the rocket was retrieved
            intact and returned to the facility in excellent condition,
            according to EPOCH.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rocket's cargo bay, measuring 120 cubic meters, is designed to
            carry up to 10 tonnes of goods and could theoretically transport
            cars and small trucks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The experimental cargo in the recent testing launch included items
            from two Taobao marketplace stores, including products from the
            National Library's official flagship store, as well as commemorative
            postcards created specifically for the test.
          </p>
          <p>
            EPOCH founder Wei Yi messaged friends immediately after the test
            "Package delivered, please check. The experimental parameters show
            that the express delivery warehouse meets the expected standards in
            fire resistance, moisture resistance and shock absorption," he
            added.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rocket company's collaboration with Alibaba's Taobao signified
            China's exploration into the burgeoning field of point-to-point
            rocket transport. This technology promises to revolutionize global
            logistics by reducing intercontinental delivery times from days to
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wei admitted that the current costs are still too high for regular
            consumer deliveries, and the initial applications will focus on
            emergency deliveries, disaster relief and supplying remote areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            "With the routine use of reusable rockets and the engineering
            application of stainless steel, rocket delivery costs are expected
            to drop significantly," said Wei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aerospace expert Cao Meng said that rocket delivery is a long-term
            plan, though it could one day enable true global "flash delivery."
          </p>
          <p>
            "It needs multiple tests to verify the reusable rocket recovery
            technology and the rocket body's strength and durability," said Cao.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the sea recovery, the XYZ-1 stainless steel rocket body showed
            no signs of damage or leakage, and the engines and electrical
            products in the tail compartment were in good condition, according
            to EPOCH.
