          <p>
            The clock is ticking, and by 31 March, millions of South Africans
            could find themselves staring at blank screens if they haven't made
            the switch to digital TV.
          </p>
          <p>
            South Africa is switching from analogue to digital TV broadcasting.
            That means the old way of receiving TV signals is being phased out,
            and if your setup isn't ready, you'll lose access to your
            free-to-air channels like SABC and Etv.
          </p>
          <p>
            Five provinces Free State, Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, and
            Mpumalanga have already had their analogue signals switched off.
            That means if you live in those areas and haven't upgraded, you're
            already out of luck. Next in line are the big four: Gauteng,
            KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Western Cape where most South
            Africans live.
          </p>
          <p>
            To continue watching free-to-air TV, all you need is a Set-Top Box
            (STB) a small decoder that connects to your current TV. It picks up
            the digital signal and shows you crystal-clear images and clearer
            sound no more fuzzy, snowy screens. You'll get access to more
            channels too. The best part? No monthly fees. It works much like a
            DStv or OpenView box, but only for free-to-air channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help low-income households, the government is offering free STBs
            to around five million qualifying households. If your household
            qualifies, all you need to do is register at your nearest SA Post
            Office.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, over 1.5 million of these decoders have been installed — but
            millions more still need them. If you're in Gauteng, KZN, Eastern
            Cape, or the Western Cape and you haven't switched to digital,
            you'll lose your TV signal after the 31 March deadline. No more
            news, soapies, or sports unless you're connected.
          </p>
          <p>Why Digital is Better</p>
          <p>
            Sharper picture <br />Better sound <br />More channels <br />No
            subscription fees <br /><br />In short: if you haven't sorted out
            your decoder yet, now's the time. Because come 31 March, your TV
            might just go dark and nobody wants to miss their favourite show.
