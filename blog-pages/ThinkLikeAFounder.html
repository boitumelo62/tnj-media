          <p>
            A lot of small creative agencies reach a point where they just can't
            seem to grow, no matter how hard they work. Talented founders often
            find themselves trapped in a cycle of over-delivering,
            undercharging, and eventually burning out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most agencies start with very little money but plenty of time. The
            issue is that because time feels abundant, founders tend to
            undervalue it. They take on every client, do all the work
            themselves, and try to make up for low fees by doing more.
          </p>
          <p>
            One key difference is between a freelancer and someone who truly
            wants to build an agency. Freelancers are fine as long as they're
            busy and making money. But an agency owner who wants to grow has to
            stop selling just their own time. Growth means building a team,
            having a strategy, and being ready to scale which takes more than
            just hard work.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's also a common belief that more revenue will fix everything.
            But if your agency isn't already profitable, taking on more clients
            just adds more stress. You need to be running efficiently first
            otherwise, you're just expanding a broken system.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of the practical stuff, there are also mental roadblocks.
            Many founders struggle to let go of control, afraid things will fall
            apart if they're not involved in everything. It's a tough shift, but
            it's necessary if you want to build something bigger than
            yourself.That means setting up clear systems, tracking progress, and
            showing up with clarity, courage, and consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Final advice is simple but powerful: buy back your time. Hand off
            what others can do more affordably, and focus on the high-impact
            work only you can do. That's where real growth begins. For any
            agency owner stuck on the hamster wheel, the message is clear stop
            trying to do more, and start doing it better.
