            The Reuters Institute's latest Digital News Report shows that South
            Africa's media landscape is going through big changes as more people
            turn to digital platforms for their news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional media like newspapers and TV are losing influence,
            partly because global trust in mainstream news has been falling.
            More and more South Africans are now getting their news from social
            media. TikTok has become a major source of news for 33% of the
            population, while 42% use YouTube.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes South Africa one of the top countries in Africa for
            watching news through social video. This trend is also part of a
            global shift where people are choosing to follow influencers or
            content creators rather than traditional journalists.
          </p>
          <p>
            On platforms like TikTok, creators are often seen as more relatable
            or trustworthy. But this also comes with a downside, misinformation.
            About 73% of South Africans say they're worried about being able to
            tell what's true and what's not online. Influencers and politicians
            are seen as some of the most likely to spread misleading
            information. Even so, established news brands are still considered
            more reliable when it comes to fact-checking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report also touches on artificial intelligence (AI) in the news.
            Some young people especially under 25 are starting to use AI tools
            like chatbots or summary generators to get news, with around 15%
            doing so. Still, there's a lot of hesitation around fully automated
            content. However, AI could play a helpful role in making news more
            accessible in a country like South Africa, where many languages are
            spoken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike wealthier countries such as the UK or Norway where many
            people pay for online news South Africa faces challenges like high
            data costs and lower digital skills, meaning people mostly rely on
            free platforms for news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these obstacles, there are real opportunities, local news,
            AI powered tools, and content that speaks to diverse communities
            could help improve access and trust. As South Africa continues to
            adapt, it's leading the way in a new kind of “social-first” news
            fast, visual, and interactive.
