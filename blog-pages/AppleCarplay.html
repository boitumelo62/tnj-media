          />
          <p>
            Apple's annual Worldwide Developers' Conference (WWDC) happened last
            week, and the tech giant announced several new updates to iOS 26,
            including upgrades for Apple CarPlay users.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you'll have to enroll in the developer beta to get early
            access, here's a quick overview of all the new features you can
            expect in Apple CarPlay by this fall.
          </p>
          <p><strong>1. New CarPlay design</strong></p>
          <p>
            Along with the redesign of iOS 26, CarPlay is following suit with a
            new look. The new design extends into the car for a consistent,
            expressive experience while you drive. This includes icons that look
            great in light or dark mode, and a more compact design for
            notifications so you can still see the directions clearly on your
            screen.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2. Widgets</strong></p>
          <p>
            Widgets will now be available to view in CarPlay for a quick way to
            get information like the weather, reminders, smart home information,
            and more. Plus, you can see live activities on your CarPlay screen
            as well, such as the status of a friend's flight while you're on
            your way to the airport to pick them up.
          </p>
          <p><strong>3. Apple CarPlay Ultra expansion</strong></p>
          <p>
            Last month, Apple debuted Apple CarPlay Ultra, which expands CarPlay
            capabilities to both your car's touchscreen and dashboard. "It
            builds on the capabilities of CarPlay and provides the ultimate
            in-car experience by deeply integrating with the vehicle to deliver
            the best of iPhone and the best of the car," Apple said in a news
            release.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, the technology is only available in new Aston Martin
            vehicle orders in the US and Canada, but last week's WWDC
            announcement confirmed that Apple is working with other carmakers
            for wider expansion. According to Top Gear, other carmakers like
            Hyundai, Kia, Ford, and Volvo are already working to add CarPlay
            Ultra into their models.
