          <h2>Tesla's Sales Keep Falling in Sweden and Denmark</h2>
          <p>
            Tesla is continuing to face serious challenges in parts of Europe,
            with its sales in Sweden and Denmark falling sharply for the sixth
            month in a row.
          </p>
          <p>
            The electric carmaker, once a dominant force in the EV market, is
            now struggling to keep up as rival brands gain ground and public
            interest in CEO Elon Musk appears to be fading.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Sweden, Tesla's vehicle registrations — a key indicator of actual
            car sales — dropped by 64.4% in June compared to the same month last
            year. The situation in Denmark was similarly bleak, with overall
            Tesla sales down 61.6%. Even the updated Model Y, which is Tesla's
            best-selling model in Europe, saw a significant dip. Sales of the
            Model Y in Denmark fell 31.2% year-over- year, with just 1,155 units
            sold in June.
          </p>
          <p>
            These continued declines point to broader issues for Tesla in the
            region. The company is facing stiff competition from both
            traditional automakers and newer EV brands that are gaining customer
            trust and offering competitive pricing, features, and incentives. At
            the same time, Elon Musk's polarizing public image — including
            political controversies — may also be affecting the brand's appeal.
            The release of Tesla's latest registration numbers came just as Musk
            reignited a public feud with former U.S. President Donald Trump.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dispute centers around a large tax-cut and government spending
            bill, and it has once again put Musk in the political spotlight — a
            space that continues to divide public opinion. Following the weak
            sales data and renewed controversy, Tesla's stock also took a hit.
            Its Frankfurt-listed shares were down 5.6% as of 7:30 a.m. GMT,
            reflecting investor concerns over the company's performance and
            future direction.
