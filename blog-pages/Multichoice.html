          <p>
            Multichoice, the company behind DStv, has made a strong financial
            comeback. After posting heavy losses of R2.9 billion and R4 billion
            in 2023 and 2024, the company reported a profit of R1.8 billion for
            the financial year ending 31 March 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            This turnaround was helped by several factors: major cost cutting
            efforts, a stronger rand, and a deal to sell 60% of its insurance
            business (NMSIS) to Sanlam, which brought in R1.2 billion after tax.
            A large portion of the profit came from what the company claims is
            R3.7 billion in cost savings nearly double its original target of R2
            billion
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when BusinessTech reviewed the financials, only about R1.5
            billion in cost savings could be directly seen in the income
            statement. That included R300 million saved in service and product
            costs and R1.2 billion from reduced admin and selling expenses. The
            remaining R2.2 billion in savings raised eyebrows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multichoice CFO Tim Jacobs explained that the R3.7 billion figure
            includes "realised" savings costs the company actively managed or
            negotiated down (like content deals or marketing) rather than just
            reductions seen in the income statement. He noted that 42% of these
            savings came from content-related spending alone, with other areas
            including renegotiated contracts, sales and marketing cuts, and
            reduced technology and transmission costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the debate over the exact savings figure, it's clear that
            Multichoice is cutting back significantly and getting its finances
            under control. It's also no longer technically insolvent, meaning
            its assets now outweigh its liabilities. The company improved its
            financial position by reducing lease liabilities, loans, and taxes
            and even repaid R927 million early on a R12 billion loan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, the company's total assets dropped by 10.5%, largely due to
            lower spending on content and reduced cash reserves. At the end of
            the financial year, it held R5.1 billion in cash, with another R3
            billion available through credit if needed
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, Multichoice appears to be tightening its belt and moving in
            a more stable direction, even as questions remain around the full
            picture of its cost savings.
