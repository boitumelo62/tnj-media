          Africa Eases Brazil Chicken Ban"

          <p>
            The Department of Agriculture has announced a partial lifting of the
            ban on poultry imports from Brazil, a move aimed at easing pressure
            on South Africa's food security
          </p>
          <p>
            The country initially banned Brazilian poultry imports in May after
            an avian flu outbreak in the Rio Grande do Sul region. The ban sent
            ripples through the local meat industry, especially affecting the
            supply of mechanically deboned meat (MDM) a key ingredient used to
            make affordable meat products like polony, viennas, Russians, and
            braaiwors.
          </p>
          <p>
            South Africa doesn't produce MDM locally and imports roughly 19,000
            tonnes of it from Brazil every month. Without it, major producers
            like Eskort warned that low cost meat options could disappear from
            shelves, leaving many households without affordable protein options.
          </p>
          <p>
            The timing couldn't have been worse. Alongside the chicken import
            ban, South Africa was also dealing with a foot-and-mouth disease
            outbreak at the country's biggest beef feedlot and the collapse of
            poultry producer DayBreak Foods. These combined challenges
            threatened to drive meat prices even higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meat processors and importers urgently called on the government to
            lift the ban, highlighting that the country was losing over 100
            million meals per week. Responding to these concerns, the department
            has now agreed to allow imports from other regions of Brazil not
            affected by the flu, starting 19 June.
          </p>
          <p>
            Industry players have welcomed the decision, but they're also
            warning that damage has already been done. The four-week ban
            disrupted supply chains, forced some processors to halt operations,
            and raised fears about job losses and wider social consequences
          </p>
          <p>
            Eskort pointed out that even a month-long break in MDM supply could
            leave many processors inactive for more than 60 days. SAMPA (the
            South African Meat Processors Association) echoed this, saying the
            partial lifting of the ban will help avoid major shortages and
            protect jobs but stressed that authorities must now be better
            prepared in case other parts of Brazil face similar outbreaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the partial ban lift comes as a relief, it highlights how
            dependent South Africa is on international supply chains for
            affordable meat, and just how quickly disruptions can become
            national issues.
