          <p>
            In California, mechanical engineer Yasaman Ghasempour is helping
            lead the development of the largest digital camera ever constructed.
            Built at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, this camera is
            designed for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, where it will
            capture the most detailed images of the night sky ever recorded.
            Weighing over three tons and holding a staggering 3.2 billion-pixel
            resolution, the camera will photograph the entire southern sky every
            few nights over a ten-year period.
          </p>
          <p>
            This camera is the heart of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a
            scientific project aimed at understanding the structure and
            evolution of the universe. By observing distant galaxies, exploding
            stars, and near-Earth objects in incredible detail, researchers hope
            to unlock secrets about dark energy, dark matter, and how the
            universe changes over time. Each night, the system will generate
            about 20 terabytes of data, creating a vast archive of the cosmos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ghasempour has been a key figure in making this possible. Born in
            Iran and trained as an engineer in the United States, she has worked
            on critical systems that ensure the camera performs with extreme
            precision. From managing temperature stability to designing
            vibration-resistant components, her work ensures that the camera
            operates without even the slightest distortion. Any error could
            compromise the massive amount of data being collected, so attention
            to detail has been crucial.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Ghasempour, the project is about more than building a machine.
            It's about creating a tool that will expand human knowledge and
            allow scientists to ask—and maybe answer—fundamental questions about
            space and time. Her contribution highlights the often-overlooked
            role of engineers in scientific discovery. While astronomers study
            the stars, it's the engineers who build the tools that make those
            discoveries possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now nearing completion, the camera will soon be shipped to Chile for
            installation. Once it begins operation, it will offer scientists a
            living, moving picture of the universe—one that will change how we
            understand our place in it. Thanks to Ghasempour and her team, the
            future of space science is about to become a lot clearer.
