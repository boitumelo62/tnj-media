            Despite pressure to raise more revenue and a promise to explore “all
            tax measures” for 2026, the National Treasury has signaled that it's
            unlikely to target Corporate Income Tax (CIT) a welcome sign for
            South African businesses
          </p>
          <p>
            Several proposals have been submitted to help address South Africa's
            longer-term R70 billion budget gap. Some suggest cutting spending,
            which risks underfunding key programmes, while others call for new
            taxes like a wealth tax or raising CIT.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Treasury was clear, raising CIT is not a preferred option. “Our
            Corporate Income Tax rate is too high,” it said, adding that
            increasing it further would make South Africa less attractive for
            investment. Local companies already pay more in corporate tax as a
            share of GDP than businesses in most other countries including OECD
            members and African peers
          </p>
          <p>
            Treasury pointed to past modelling that shows just how damaging CIT
            hikes can be. A study from 2014/15 found that raising R45 billion
            through CIT would have caused the economy to shrink by 2.64%. That's
            worse than the impact of raising the same amount via personal income
            tax or VAT.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the CIT rate was cut from 28% to 27% in 2022, there was no
            negative impact at all. By contrast, to raise just R28 billion
            through CIT today, the rate would have to climb to 33% far above
            international averages. That, Treasury warned, could lead companies
            to cut jobs, slow down investment, or pass costs onto consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            South Africa has now passed the global minimum tax (GMT) into law.
            Starting in 2026/27, large multinational corporations local and
            foreign will face higher effective tax rates under the new rules.
            These companies already contribute over a third of CIT revenue, and
            Treasury says they won't be able to sidestep the new global minimum.
