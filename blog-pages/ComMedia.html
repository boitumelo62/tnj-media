            Building a sustainable community and small commercial media sector in South Africa is critical. These media outlets community, radio, TV, and local publications are key to democracy, providing access to information, freedom of expression, and giving a voice to those often unheard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over 200 community radio stations and 300 local publishers serve millions, especially in areas where mainstream media doesn't reach. This year marks 30 years since South Africa licensed its first community radio station, creating a vital third tier of broadcasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the sector is struggling. Most organisations survive on limited donor funds and small ad revenues, while digital platforms and a weak economy have cut into their income. Only 7% are fully sustainable; the rest are either barely surviving or failing. High costs, weak governance, poor audience data, and constant staff turnover make matters worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Community media lacks stable income. Government support is patchy, and local advertising is hard to attract. Many outlets can't afford proper marketing, can't measure their audience, and can't pay competitive wages leading to high staff losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) is stepping in with solutions. It's working on better audience measurement, improving governance with toolkits and workshops, and training in sales, finance, and leadership. It also urges government to reserve part of its ad spend for community media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some stations are innovating offering media training, renting studios, or launching funeral policies to earn extra money. Despite challenges, community media remains vital, reaching millions and preserving local languages and cultures
          </p>
          <p>
            To help the sector grow, the MDDA has introduced six strategic pillars, aligned with UNESCO's standards, to assess impact and build long-term sustainability.</br> The message is clear, community media matters with the right support, it can thrive.
