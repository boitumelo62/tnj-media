          <p>
            HIV has remained incurable for more than four decades largely
            because of its ability to hide. Even when people take antiretroviral
            therapy (ART) that suppresses the virus to undetectable levels, HIV
            doesn't go away. Instead, it retreats into so-called “latent
            reservoirs” — pockets of infected immune cells where the virus lies
            dormant and invisible to both the immune system and HIV drugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco
            (UCSF), in partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
            have found a new way to force the virus out of hiding using
            messenger RNA — or mRNA.
          </p>
          <p>
            mRNA, short for messenger Ribonucleic acid, is a type of molecule
            that tells cells what proteins to make. Think of it as a set of
            temporary instructions — a biological text message — that the cell
            reads and uses to build specific proteins.
          </p>
          <p>
            This technology became widely known during the COVID-19 pandemic,
            when mRNA vaccines taught cells how to make a harmless piece of the
            coronavirus spike protein, training the immune system to recognize
            and fight the real virus. Now, scientists are using the same idea to
            tackle HIV in a completely different way.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this study, the scientists used specially designed mRNA to
            deliver instructions into immune cells, telling them to produce a
            protein that reactivates dormant HIV. Once the virus is active
            again, it becomes visible to the immune system and can potentially
            be targeted and destroyed — either by the body's natural defenses or
            with additional treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is part of a broader approach researchers call “shock and
            kill.” The goal is to “shock” the hidden virus into revealing
            itself, then “kill” it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previous efforts to do this often caused unwanted side effects or
            only partially woke the virus. But the mRNA method appears both
            effective and safe. In lab tests using blood from people living with
            HIV who are on ART, the mRNA technique successfully reactivated the
            virus in over 80% of samples — without triggering harmful
            inflammation or damaging healthy cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We've shown that mRNA can wake up HIV in a controlled, precise
            way,” said Dr. Anjali Deshmukh, the study's lead researcher. “That's
            a major step toward clearing the virus completely from the body.”
          </p>
          <p>
            While this doesn't cure HIV on its own, it's a critical step in the
            right direction. The reactivated virus still needs to be eliminated.
            To do that, scientists are now working on pairing this mRNA-based
            "shock" with immune therapies or vaccines that could deliver the
            "kill."
          </p>
          <p>
            The findings are still in early stages, but they represent one of
            the most promising uses of mRNA in HIV cure research to date.
            Clinical trials in people could begin in the next couple of years.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is a powerful example of how the lessons from COVID-19 are now
            helping us fight one of the world's toughest viruses,” said Dr. Carl
            Dieffenbach, director of the Division of AIDS at the NIH. “We're not
            there yet, but this brings us closer than ever to a functional
            cure.”
