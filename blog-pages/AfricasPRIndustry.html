          <p>
            Last week, the African Public Relations Association (APRA), which is
            celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, teamed up with the
            Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) to share the
            latest findings from their annual research into ethics and the state
            of public relations across Africa. The report was presented during
            APRA's annual conference in Mombasa, Kenya, and was conducted by
            Reputation Matters, a leading African research consultancy
          </p>
          <p>
            This study has now been running for six years, tracking ethical
            standards and, for the past four years, looking at broader trends in
            the PR industry. For the second year in a row, the research also
            examined the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on
            the profession. This year's edition was the most inclusive yet, with
            313 PR professionals from 24 African countries taking part. South
            Africa had the largest share of responses, followed by Kenya,
            Nigeria, Cameroon, and Mauritius. The responses paint a diverse
            picture of a profession navigating change while holding firmly to
            ethical foundations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The findings show a communications industry under pressure from
            fast-moving digital innovation, but still rooted in key values.
            Corruption remains the most pressing ethical challenge, with many
            respondents pointing to broader issues like cultural norms, social
            injustice, and weak law enforcement as factors that erode public
            trust. At the same time, the study found that 69% of participants
            view AI as a valuable tool that can support, rather than replace,
            traditional PR functions. Still, concerns remain over how this
            technology could be used to spread misinformation or manipulate
            audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are signs of progress when it comes to PR's role in the
            boardroom. While 40% of respondents say the profession is still
            undervalued at leadership level, 38% note an increase in how often
            business leaders rely on PR advice a notable rise from last year's
            31%. However, many professionals still feel there are gaps in
            training, particularly in areas like crisis communication, strategic
            planning, and reputation management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite a slight drop in the overall number of survey responses
            compared to 2024, the broader regional participation suggests that
            PR is maturing across the continent. There is a growing recognition
            of its value in building trust, especially in times of institutional
            or reputational crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            APRA President Arik Karani emphasized the importance of ethical
            communication in today's uncertain world, saying, “In an era where
            trust is fragile, the value of ethical public relations has never
            been clearer.” Sarah Waddington CBE, interim CEO of PRCA, echoed
            this, noting that while the profession is showing more awareness of
            its responsibilities, it must continue to strengthen its commitment
            to ethics and responsible AI use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report identifies three key pillars for the future of PR in
            Africa: ethical clarity, strategic credibility, and ongoing
            professional growth. Regine le Roux, managing director of Reputation
            Matters, summed it up by saying that PR today is about more than
            just managing public perception it's about building trust and
            driving positive change.
          </p>
          <p>
            To continue the conversation, PRCA Africa and APRA will host a live
            panel discussion through the Ethics and Practices Network. The
            session will explore the report's insights further and focus on how
            ethics can guide the profession in a rapidly changing digital world.
