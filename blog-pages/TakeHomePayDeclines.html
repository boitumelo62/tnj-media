          <p>
            The latest figures from BankservAfrica show that the average take
            home pay in South Africa has declined for the third month in a row,
            with May 2025's average slipping to R17,296.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's about 1.3% lower than in April, when the average stood at
            R17,532. Still, compared to May 2024, the figure is higher then, the
            average take-home pay was R15,903. This ongoing slowdown reflects a
            struggling economic environment. The country saw little to no growth
            in the first quarter of 2025, and global uncertainty especially the
            instability in the Middle East is weighing heavily on the outlook.
          </p>
          <p>
            BankservAfrica, which compiles its data from about 3.8 million South
            African salary earners, noted that this downward trend is being felt
            in both nominal and real terms. Once adjusted for inflation, real
            take home pay dropped to R14,832 in May, down from R15,003 in April.
            Even so, earnings in real terms remain nearly 6% higher than a year
            ago, helped by inflation that has eased significantly headline
            inflation for May was recorded at just 2.8%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although prices eased again after ceasefire talks, the risk of
            further volatility remains high.South Africa's fuel prices are
            already under pressure. Daily data suggests an under- recovery of
            between 50 and 80 cents per litre, which could translate into a hike
            of around R1.00 per litre for petrol and R1.30 for diesel at the
            start of July. If this trend continues, consumer inflation could
            rise toward 5% by year end, well above the current 3.6% forecast.
            This in turn might limit the Reserve Bank's ability to lower
            interest rates, even though the economy could use a boost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these headwinds, some positive signs remain. Real take-home
            pay is still expected to grow this year, which should help support
            consumer demand. And while salary growth is slowing slightly, it is
            still outpacing inflation. According to the Remchannel Salary and
            Wage Movement Survey from April 2025, salaries are projected to rise
            by an average of 5.82% this year, down slightly from 6.09% in 2024.
            This suggests employers are being more cautious, balancing pay
            increases with tighter budgets.
          </p>
          <p>Employment, however, is showing worrying signs.</p>
          <p>
            The most recent data from Statistics South Africa revealed that the
            formal non-agricultural sector lost 74,000 jobs in the first quarter
            of 2025. Overall employment dropped from 10.65 million in December
            2024 to 10.58 million by March 2025. Over the year from March 2024
            to March 2025, 95,000 formal sector jobs were lost. When including
            informal and household employment, the broader Labour Force Survey
            shows a more concerning picture: 291,000 job losses in Q1 alone,
            pushing the unemployment rate to 32.9%.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, while South Africans are seeing some gains in real income
            thanks to low inflation, the broader economic picture remains
            fragile. Rising fuel prices, weak job growth, and a tough global
            environment mean both workers and businesses are likely to stay
            cautious in the months ahead.
