          <p>
            A ransomware attack on the UK's National Health Service (NHS) in
            June 2024 has now been linked to the death of a patient, according
            to an official review conducted by King's College Hospital NHS
            Foundation Trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cyberattack, carried out by the Russian-linked group Qilin,
            targeted Synnovis, a pathology services provider. It disrupted blood
            testing services across London hospitals and GP offices, forcing the
            cancellation of over 10,000 appointments and more than 1,000
            operations. One direct consequence, investigators say, was a
            dangerous delay in returning critical blood test results for a
            patient who later died.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spokesperson for the trust confirmed that “a number of
            contributing factors” led to the fatal outcome, including “a long
            wait for a blood test result due to the cyberattack impacting
            pathology services at the time.” The conclusion follows mounting
            concern over the real-world dangers of cyberattacks on public
            healthcare systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond delays in care, the attackers also stole and published nearly
            400GB of sensitive patient data, including NHS numbers, names, and
            medical records. The breach caused a severe shortage of O type blood
            and left parts of London's healthcare system struggling to operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In comments to the BBC, the Qilin group offered a vague apology but
            denied responsibility, claiming the attack was a form of political
            retaliation related to an unspecified war involving the UK.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experts are now calling for deeper scrutiny into the NHS's
            cybersecurity. Dr. Saif Abed, a former NHS doctor and cybersecurity
            expert, told the Financial Times that this case may only be “the tip
            of the iceberg,” and warned that other patient deaths may have gone
            unreported due to the absence of proper investigations. He urged
            immediate action in the form of an independent inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The incident follows a similar case in Germany in 2022, when a
            cyberattack forced a hospital transfer that delayed treatment and
            led to the death of a critically ill patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, healthcare systems around
            the world are under increasing pressure to strengthen digital
            defenses and prepare for potentially deadly consequences.
