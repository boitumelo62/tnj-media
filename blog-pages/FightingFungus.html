            In a new innovative medical discovery, it has been discovered that
            two compounds derived from the cannabis (marijuana) plant have shown
            powerful antifungal properties in a new study led by researchers at
            Macquarie University. The compounds—cannabidiol (CBD) and
            cannabidivarin (CBDV)— have been found to kill dangerous fungi more
            quickly than current treatments, offering hope for new therapies
            against infections that affect millions of people worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The study was been published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and
            focused on the deadly fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (which
            can cause lung or brain infections - cryptococcal meningitis), is
            listed by the World Health Organization as a priority health threat.
            Current forms of treatment are often slow to work limited
            effectiveness, which has resulted in an urgent search for better
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the conducted lab experiments, CBD and CBDV rapidly killed
            Cryptococcus neoformans. These cannabinoids also proved effective
            against other fungal species, including dermatophytes that cause
            common skin infections such as athlete's foot. The speed at which
            the cannabinoids worked surprised the researchers, as they
            outperformed standard antifungal treatments in these tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Postdoctoral research fellow at Macquarie University's School of
            Natural Sciences, Dr. Hue Dinh, led the study alongside Associate
            Professor Amy Cain. In a research team that included pharmacologist
            Professor Mark Connor and Dr. Marina Junqueira Santiago from the
            Macquarie School of Medicine, along with collaborators from the
            Universities of Sydney and New South Wales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Dinh explained that the team chose to investigate cannabinoids
            because they are already approved for human use in other contexts,
            like pain management or epilepsy, meaning their safety profiles are
            well known.
          </p>
          <p>
            The development of brand-new drugs from scratch can take decades,
            therefore using compounds with an established track record can speed
            up the process of finding new treatments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of the hundreds of natural chemicals in the cannabis plant, CBD
            and CBDV stood out in their ability to kill harmful fungi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The researchers tested the cannabinoids against 33 different fungal
            pathogens from medical, veterinary, and environmental sources. Both
            CBD and CBDV performed well against various strains of Cryptococcus
            and other fungi, suggesting they have broad antifungal potential.
          </p>
          <img src="/blog-pages/imges/news/FightingFungus3.webp" alt="" />
          <p>
            Dr. Dinh noted that topical treatments—such as creams or oils
            applied to the skin—are likely to be the first practical use for
            these findings. Cannabinoids are not easily turned into injectable
            drugs, making it more difficult to treat serious internal infections
            like fungal pneumonia or meningitis with this method.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Imagine being able to buy CBD oil over the counter to treat
            athlete's foot or similar infections,” said Dr. Dinh. “It's not just
            exciting scientifically—it could really help people.”
          </p>
          <p>
            One additional advantage of using cannabinoids is that fungi may be
            less likely to develop resistance to them, compared to traditional
            antifungal medications. This makes cannabinoids a promising option
            in the fight against growing antimicrobial resistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The research team is now working with commercial partners to develop
            CBD-based products that could eventually be sold in pharmacies and
            stores. While more testing and development are still needed, this
            discovery could pave the way for a new generation of antifungal
            treatments derived from a plant that continues to surprise
            scientists with its medical potential.
