          />
          <p>
            Elective egg freezing (EEF) is gaining attention as an option for
            women seeking to delay motherhood—but experts are urging caution
            over its limitations and broader implications.
          </p>
          <p>
            A recent piece in The Straits Times questioned whether EEF is a
            solution to Singapore's fertility challenges, highlighting research
            from abroad showing that most women who freeze their eggs never use
            them. A 2018 U.S. study further suggests that nearly half of these
            women experience regret.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sociologists point out that many women turn to EEF because they
            haven't found a long-term partner, or due to emotional or financial
            unreadiness for parenthood. In Singapore, legal restrictions pose a
            unique dilemma: only married heterosexual couples may use frozen
            eggs, ruling out singles and same-sex couples. Cohabitation does not
            fulfill legal requirements, limiting options for many users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experts also emphasize health considerations, urging women to
            honestly assess whether they will still be able to care for a child
            if the procedure is delayed into later life. Life-readiness
            encompasses more than biology—it includes physical stamina,
            emotional resilience, and long-term support systems.
          </p>
          <h3>Disposal and Donation Dilemmas</h3>
          <p>
            Several end-of-use options exist—destruction, donation to another
            woman, research purposes, or exporting eggs abroad to single mothers
            using donor sperm. Yet each route has drawbacks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Financial investment in storage may go to waste.</li>
            <li>Donation involves complex psychosocial decisions.</li>
            <li>
              Exporting eggs internationally carries logistical risks and legal
              stigma: single-parent status can block financial subsidies and
              inheritance rights, and success rates may be affected by transport
              mismatches.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Career vs. Motherhood</h3>
          <p>
            For women delaying for career or financial goals, the calculus
            includes weighing reduced fertility success later against potential
            gains in income or professional stability.
          </p>
          <h3>Cultural Pressure</h3>
          <p>
            In Singapore's conservative milieu, postponing motherhood for
            lifestyle reasons can draw strong criticism. Many women face the
            dual pressure of societal expectations to have children and the fear
            that the investment in egg freezing may be wasted.
          </p>
          <h3>No Guarantees</h3>
          <p>
            Egg freezing is no guarantee of motherhood. While some women
            conceive naturally, others may endure disappointment and emotional
            distress after a failed attempt.
