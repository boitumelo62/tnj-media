          <p>
            A public rift between President Donald Trump and tech billionaire
            Elon Musk intensified on Thursday, as both figures exchanged sharp
            criticisms over recent policy decisions and their political
            alliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The discord surfaced during a meeting between President Trump and
            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the White House. Trump expressed
            disappointment in Musk's criticism of the "One Big Beautiful Bill
            Act," a significant spending package championed by the
            administration. The bill includes substantial cuts to electric
            vehicle subsidies, a move that Musk, CEO of Tesla, has vocally
            opposed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response, Musk took to X (formerly Twitter), accusing Trump of
            "ingratitude" and asserting that the former president would not have
            won the 2024 election without his support. Musk further alleged that
            Trump was implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein files, suggesting that
            the release of these documents had been halted due to Trump's
            involvement.

          />
          <p>
            The fallout has had immediate financial repercussions. Tesla's stock
            experienced a significant decline, dropping nearly 15%—its worst day
            since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, shares of
            Trump Media & Technology Group fell 8%, and the $TRUMP
            cryptocurrency saw a 12% decrease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Political analysts view this escalation as a pivotal moment in the
            relationship between the two influential figures. The feud
            underscores the complexities of their alliance and its potential
            impact on their respective ventures and political ambitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the situation develops, both Trump and Musk remain central
            figures in American politics and business, with their public dispute
            drawing widespread attention.
