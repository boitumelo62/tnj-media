            It's just been a couple of days since Apple announced iPhone iOS 26
            at WWDC and, like clockwork, Google has only gone and released
            Android 16. But unlike iOS 26, Android 16 is already available for
            some Pixel devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Android 16 is available for Pixel 6 phones and newer, and you no
            longer need to sign up for the Android Beta for Pixel programme to
            get started. Not seen an update notice pop up on your phone yet?
            With any luck an over-the-air package should be heading your way
            soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're hoping for a big visual revamp on your phone or tablet,
            though, you have a little longer to wait. While Android 16 will
            introduce a new look dubbed Material 3 Expressive, that won't come
            to the platform until September 3, according to Android Authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            The software brings a reworked presentation of notifications that
            seems entirely geared towards food delivery apps like Deliveroo and
            Uber Eats. Google's pitch is that instead of having to head into the
            app to see the ETA updates on your pizza or curry, there'll be a
            shortcut accessible from the top of the homescreen, in the phone's
            status bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google also claims to have improved security, with what it calls
            Advanced Protection. Exciting? No. But it does seem to be a “set it
            and forget it” feature that should make your phone more secure.
            Things it does include — for example — Inactivity Reboot, where the
            phone restarts after 72 hours of idle time, making “user data
            unreadable until a fresh unlock takes place.” Coming later this
            year, Android 16 will also offer a more desktop-style view for
            tablets, or phones plugged into bigger displays.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has been around for years in third-party Android software and,
            sure enough, this take on it was developed in co-operation with
            Samsung. Its own take on the concept is called DeX, which you may
            well have encountered if you own a Samsung Galaxy tablet. It will
            let you move apps around in resizeable windows, just as you might do
            on a MacBook or a Windows 11 PC. Google says Android 16 will come to
            other phones “later this year.” But, as ever, those third-party
            upgrades can take their sweet time. If you want to read more on
            Android 16's tweaks and features, take a look at the Android
            website.
