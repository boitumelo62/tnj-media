            The United States is set to double tariffs on imported steel and
            aluminum starting Wednesday, according to an order released by the
            White House and signed by former President Donald Trump. This move
            will raise the existing tariffs on these metals from 25% to 50%.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the higher rates will apply broadly, imports from the United
            Kingdom will still be subject to the original 25% tariff for now.
            Both countries are continuing negotiations around duties and quotas
            based on a previous trade agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the official order, the goal of the tariff hike is to
            better protect U.S. steel and aluminum industries from foreign
            competition particularly from countries that flood the American
            market with cheap, excess supply. The administration argues that
            such practices undermine the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers
            and could pose national security risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Increasing the tariffs will strengthen these industries and help
            eliminate the threat caused by imports of steel and aluminum
            products,” the order stated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trump had previewed the decision during a speech at a U.S. Steel
            plant in Pennsylvania last week, telling workers, “Nobody is going
            to be able to steal your industry. At 25 percent, they can sort of
            get over that fence. At 50 percent, they can no longer get over the
            fence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the move has sparked concern among key U.S. trading
            partners. Over the weekend, the European Union warned that it may
            retaliate, criticizing the sudden tariff hike as a step that
            “undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution” between
            the EU and the United States.
