          <h2>The Hidden Cost of Poor Contracts in Modern Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            In today's fast-changing marketing landscape, contracts are no
            longer just legal documents filed away and forgotten. They've become
            critical tools for financial control and accountability. That was
            the key message from the latest Media Marketing Compliance (MCC)
            Masterclass, hosted by the Independent Agency Search & Selection
            Company (IAS).
          </p>
          <p>
            The session brought marketing procurement professionals face to face
            with a reality that's becoming hard to ignore: contracts simply
            aren't keeping up with the rapid pace of industry change. Stephen
            Broderick, Senior Partner at MCC, and Jane Dormer, Client Services
            Director, led the session and highlighted just how big the challenge
            has become.
          </p>
          <p>
            Broderick pointed out that contracts are often filled with grey
            areas, many of which aren't immediately obvious. If no one is
            monitoring them closely, it's all too easy for costs to quietly slip
            through the cracks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long ago, marketing teams worked with a handful of partners —
            media, PR, creative, and maybe an activation agency. Contracts were
            often brief, and in some cases, not even signed. But the industry
            has since exploded in complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2010s introduced principal-based media buying, programmatic
            trading, social platforms, and the unbundling of content production.
            Now in the 2020s, marketers are also navigating influencer deals,
            e-commerce platforms, affiliate networks, and retail media. The
            arrival of AI has added even more complications, especially around
            issues like intellectual property, data ownership, and compliance
            with third-party platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, the number and length of contracts have skyrocketed.
            What used to be simple agreements are now 100-page legal documents.
            And while contracts have gotten more complex, procurement teams have
            not grown at the same pace. Dormer noted that budgets and staffing
            haven't kept up, forcing teams to prioritise which contracts get the
            attention they deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, the traditional business model that agencies
            relied on — generating profit through high-volume media buying — has
            collapsed. Tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon have disrupted
            the space, while retail media is increasingly cutting agencies out
            of the picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            With pressure mounting, many agencies still need to hit historical
            profit margins. That's led to a troubling trend: exploiting unclear
            contract terms and taking advantage of client blind spots wherever
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            One example shows just how serious the issue has become. A recent
            ANA study on programmatic media revealed that 70% of ad spend —
            including agency fees — didn't lead to ads being seen by actual
            people. That's not efficient advertising; that's a very expensive
            game of digital hide and seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research from MCC shows that 62% of advertisers say the biggest
            barrier to managing contracts effectively is simply a lack of time.
            It's a vicious cycle — as contracts grow more complicated, teams
            have even less time to understand and manage them properly. And
            those blind spots are exactly where value is lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way forward doesn't require reinvention, but it does call for a
            shift in mindset. Clients need to expect more: more clarity, more
            evidence, and stronger compliance. That means moving away from a
            mindset of chasing refunds and toward one focused on building value.
            It also means choosing partners who are transparent and investing in
            systems that can monitor contracts in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Johanna McDowell, CEO of IAS, said the time for these conversations
            is long overdue. The masterclass was commissioned because far too
            many marketers are unknowingly bleeding value due to poor contract
            visibility. This isn't just about clawing back lost profit — it's
            about creating fair, modern partnerships that reflect the complex
            marketing ecosystem we live in today.
          </p>
          <p>
            The message is clear: take a step back and take a serious look at
            your contracts. Because in a world where margins are shrinking and
            agency models are under pressure, the real power could be in the
            fine print. The era of treating contracts as a low priority is over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real question now isn't whether your procurement team can afford
            to focus on contracts — it's whether you can afford not to.
