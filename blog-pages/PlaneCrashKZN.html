          <p>
            Three people lost their lives in a tragic plane crash on Sunday. In
            the rush to report the story, several news outlets shared an image
            circulating online an image that turned out to be fake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many even added their own watermarks or photo credit logos to it,
            making it seem more credible than it actually was, But the image had
            clear signs of being AI-generated, and even a quick glance could've
            revealed it was fake:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The crash happened in a forest, yet there are no trees in the
              picture.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of the supposed rescue workers appears to have three legs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The aircraft in the image is the wrong colour, and the plane's
              registration code usually black is white.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What's most shocking is the level of detail someone went to in order
            to create the fake. The image even included the correct registration
            code of the real plane involved in the crash, suggesting it was
            deliberately made to mislead.
          </p>
          <h3>What are deepfake images?</h3>
          <p>
            'Deepfakes' refer to highly realistic but fake images, videos, or
            audio clips, often created using AI. These kinds of manipulations
            have existed for years, long before AI became mainstream think
            Photoshop. But today's tools can make fakes much more convincing,
            and they're spreading faster than ever.
          </p>
          <h3>How to spot AI-generated images</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Watch for extra or missing limbs (like an extra hand or leg).
            </li>
            <li>
              Look closely at faces they're often slightly off or distorted.
            </li>
            <li>Check text in the image it may look oddly foreign.</li>
            <li>
              Look at shadows, reflections, and colours are they consistent and
              realistic?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Tributes are pouring in for Nqobile Biyela, a 22-year-old pilot who
            tragically lost her life in the crash. She and two other qualified
            pilots from Eagle Air Flight School had departed from Virginia
            Airport in Durban, heading back to their base in Pretoria.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group was supposed to stop and refuel at the Ladysmith airstrip,
            but that stop didn't go as planned. They were redirected to the
            Greytown airstrip instead but never made it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their light aircraft crashed in a eucalyptus plantation owned by
            Sappi, just outside Mooi River. The wreckage was discovered by a
            plantation worker the next morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            In total, three planes from the same flight school were flying that
            day. One crash landed in sugarcane fields near Greytown fortunately,
            both pilots only had minor injuries. The third aircraft landed
            safely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eagle Air Flight School's general manager, identified only as
            Matthew, confirmed all passengers were qualified pilots. He said the
            matter is now being investigated by the police and declined to
            comment further.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who knew Biyela shared their sorrow and condolences on social
            media:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “There is no pain greater than burying your child, and it must be
              excruciating when the child has grown this far. Condolences to the
              family, and may God be with you during this time of mourning,”
              wrote Mndeni Mlaba.
            </li>
            <li>
              “The death of such a young person with such a skill is very
              painful. Condolences to the family and friends,” said Sandile
              Nota.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Such a young and beautiful girl… may God heal her mother and all
              family members and friends of the three families. May their souls
              rest in peace,” shared Dephefost Motau.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As of publishing, the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport had not
            yet officially named the other two victims
