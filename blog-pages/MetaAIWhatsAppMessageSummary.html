          <p>
            Meta is introducing a new AI-powered feature into WhatsApp designed
            to summarize unread messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The feature, called Message Summaries, was announced Wednesday in a
            WhatsApp company blog post. Message Summaries leverages Meta AI to
            provide brief, bulleted lists outlining key points from a message
            chain on the social messaging app. It's built upon Meta's Private
            Processing technology, which means the summaries are conveyed
            privately to users without any of the information being shared with
            Meta or WhatsApp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Message Summaries appear at the top of WhatsApp message chains as a
            small, rectangular icon listing the number of unread messages in the
            chat. Simply tap the icon, and Meta AI will generate a bulleted list
            of high-level key points extracted from the messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The feature is intended to provide users with quick updates when
            they don't have time to dig into the full contents of a message
            thread -- for example, when they're quickly checking their phone in
            between meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apple introduced a similar AI-powered text-summarization feature in
            October as part of its Apple Intelligence software package.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meta AI, the company's suite of AI products and services, was first
            integrated with WhatsApp in September 2023 when it was rolled out as
            a circular blue button users could press to interact with an AI
            assistant. The company received some backlash over concerns that the
            integration would jeopardize user privacy, prompting it to introduce
            a new Advanced Chat Privacy setting in April.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company's ongoing effort to fuse Meta AI into WhatsApp -- widely
            considered to be the world's most popular messaging app -- is part
            of a broader trend among tech companies to make AI accessible within
            helpful daily tools. Earlier this month, for example, OpenAI
            announced that its image-generating AI feature could also now be
            accessed via WhatsApp.
          </p>
          <p><strong>How to try it</strong></p>
          <p>
            Message Summaries is optional for users and turned off by default.
            To activate, open your WhatsApp account and toggle to Settings >
            Chats > Private Processing. You can also select which chats you'd
            like Meta AI to be able to access (or not) via Advanced Chat
            Privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Message Summaries is currently being rolled out in English across
            the US. The company said in a blog post that it hopes to make the
            feature available across more languages and countries later this
            year.
