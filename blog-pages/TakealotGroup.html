          <p>
            Despite recording another financial loss, the Takealot Group is
            confident that it will turn a profit in the current financial year.
            The group's parent company, Naspers, reported that Takealot
            experienced strong growth in the second half of the 2025 financial
            year, largely thanks to improved customer services and its growing
            TakealotMore subscription programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Naspers' full-year results, Takealot's revenue rose by
            20% in US dollar terms, reaching $823 million (about R14 billion).
            Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) also grew by 13% year-on-year, showing
            a rebound after a slow start. The group's gross profit margin
            improved by 1%, supported by high-performing segments like Mr D's
            grocery delivery service.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this revenue growth didn't translate into profits. Takealot
            posted an adjusted loss before interest and tax (aEBIT) of $12
            million (around R217 million). This was mainly due to increased
            spending on marketing and infrastructure, as the group gears up to
            face competition from new global players like Amazon, which launched
            in South Africa last year.
          </p>
          <p>
            While still in the red, Takealot has narrowed its loss from $14
            million the previous year. Naspers remains optimistic, saying the
            group is still on track to become profitable in the 2026 financial
            year. Part of its strategy has included selling off

            and acquiring M24 Logistics to strengthen delivery capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customer loyalty continues to rise, with the TakealotMore programme
            encouraging more frequent purchases and a growing number of orders.

            itself saw a 19% revenue increase to $706 million (R12.7 billion),
            while Mr D's revenue rose by 11% to $117 million (R2.1 billion). Mr
            D also saw a huge 81% surge in grocery GMV and turned a $4 million
            profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group has also been investing in greener logistics, expanding
            its fleet of electric delivery trucks, which is now one of the
            largest in South Africa. While Takealot is one of the most familiar
            Naspers brands in South Africa, the broader Naspers group is far
            more extensive, with most of its value tied to its international
            holdings most notably, its stake in Chinese tech giant Tencent.
            Naspers and its Dutch-listed subsidiary Prosus have a combined
            market value of about R3 trillion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year ending March 2025, Prosus' e-commerce operations
            delivered a strong performance, with adjusted earnings before
            interest and tax of $443 million (R8 billion). The group's overall
            aEBIT jumped to $130 million (R2.3 billion), and core headline
            earnings climbed 46% to $3.1 billion (R56 billion).
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, Naspers CEO Fabricio Bloisi said the company is
            rapidly evolving into a global tech driven lifestyle e-commerce
            leader.

            capacity. As a sign of confidence, the Prosus board has recommended
            doubling its dividend from 10 euro cents to 20 euro cents per share.
