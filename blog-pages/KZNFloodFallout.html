          <p>
            Toyota's insurance company, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance,
            is suing the KwaZulu- Natal provincial government, Transnet, and the
            eThekwini Municipality for R6.5 billion in damages.
          </p>
          <p>
            This legal action stems from the extensive damage suffered by Toyota
            South Africa Motors' Prospecton plant in Durban during the April
            2022 floods. The insurer claims that the responsible authorities
            failed to maintain crucial infrastructure designed to protect the
            industrial area from flooding, which led directly to the disaster.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to court papers filed in the Durban High Court, the R6.5
            billion claim includes R4.5 billion for repair and reinstatement
            work and R2 billion for business interruption losses. While Toyota
            South Africa Motors is listed as the official plaintiff, Tokio
            Marine is the one actively pursuing the lawsuit. This is possible
            because of a legal principle called subrogation, which allows an
            insurer to recover losses from third parties responsible for the
            damage, effectively stepping into the insured's shoes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toyota clarified that it is not funding or managing the legal
            proceedings and will not benefit financially from the case. The
            lawsuit names Transnet, the KZN Department of Transport, and the
            eThekwini Municipality as defendants. The insurer alleges that these
            entities failed to maintain vital flood prevention systems,
            including the Umlaas Canal and an adjacent diversion berm, both of
            which are critical in managing stormwater and protecting the
            Prospecton Industrial Area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transnet is said to own and be responsible for maintaining the
            Umlaas Canal, a concrete- lined channel designed to divert the
            uMlazi River. The Department of Transport is accused of neglecting
            the maintenance of the diversion berm, while the eThekwini
            Municipality was responsible for the broader stormwater network. The
            insurer argues that the defendants' collective failure to repair
            earlier damage, perform regular maintenance, and respond effectively
            to risks resulted in stormwater breaching the berm and flooding the
            area.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flooding caused severe structural damage to the plant and its
            systems, including electrical installations, plumbing, air
            conditioning, and assembly lines. Additionally, thousands of
            vehicles were damaged beyond repair, along with equipment and office
            contents. Operations at the plant were halted for more than three
            months, resulting in significant production losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the devastation, Toyota launched an intensive
            recovery effort, supported by its global team. The plant resumed
            production in August 2022. Despite the quick turnaround, the
            extended shutdown led to the loss of thousands of vehicles that
            could not be built during that period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, Toyota South Africa Motors has invested around R236
            million to protect the facility from future flooding. This includes
            R108 million spent on monitoring and maintenance systems, such as
            early warning weather alerts and improved stormwater canals. An
            additional R128 million was used for internal upgrades like raising
            doorways, installing bund walls around key infrastructure, and
            making other changes to protect the plant even if external systems
            fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2022 floods were declared a national disaster by President Cyril
            Ramaphosa and caused widespread damage across KwaZulu-Natal.
            Toyota's Prospecton plant was among the hardest hit industrial
            sites, with experts describing the event as the most significant
            damage ever recorded at any Toyota production facility worldwide.
