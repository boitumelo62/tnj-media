          <p>
            These days, it can feel like AI is taking over everything and in the
            world of marketing, that's creating a lot of questions. What does
            this mean for creativity? Strategy? Jobs? It's normal to feel
            uncertain as technology changes how we work and live so
            quickly.Human ideas, emotions, and creativity are what bring brands
            to life. Technology is a tool but it's people who use it to connect,
            inspire, and innovate.
          </p>
          <h3>Growing Talent, Building Resilience</h3>
          <p>
            At the ACA, we see talent development as the heart of a strong,
            future ready industry. Supporting people at every stage of their
            careers isn't just the right thing to do it's how we keep our
            industry thriving in a fast changing world.That's why we're
            continuing to invest in meaningful education and development
            opportunities through a range of initiatives.
          </p>
          <h3>Introducing GenEra</h3>
          <p>
            Recently, we relaunched GenEra (previously known as FutureBallers).
            It's a space for young professionals in ACA member agencies to come
            together, learn from each other, and connect in a more relaxed,
            supportive environment.Through regular in person sessions, GenEra
            helps early career professionals navigate the real challenges of
            agency life with advice, mentorship, and plenty of shared
            experiences. Plus, GenEra participants get exclusive access to the
            school of thoughts, a learning hub for marketers to build skills,
            gain insights, and keep growing.
          </p>
          <h3>Supporting All Kinds of Talent</h3>
          <p>
            Our commitment doesn't stop with young professionals. We're also
            focused on making sure that all voices in our industry are heard and
            nurtured.That includes ongoing bursary programmes to help new talent
            break into the industry, and the continued success of our women in
            leadership programme now in its fifth round. By the end of this
            intake, 100 mid to senior level women will have had the chance to
            grow their leadership skills through mentorship and personal
            development.
          </p>
          <h3>Learning at Every Level</h3>
          <p>
            We've also introduced the Effie Academy, with learning opportunities
            for marketers at all stages of their careers. From Effie
            fundamentals (a flexible, on-demand course platform) to Effie
            College (hands on experience for marketing students), we're helping
            professionals stay sharp, relevant, and ready for what's next.
          </p>
          <h3>A Long-Term Commitment to People</h3>
          <p>
            Our belief is simple, when people have acces they gain confidence,
            when they feel part of a community they create better work. And when
            they are supported they stay and strive.At the ACA, we're playing
            the long game investing in talent, inclusion, and education so that
            our industry grows stronger, smarter, and more human, no matter how
            much the world changes.
