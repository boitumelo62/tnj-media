            Goodyear has officially announced that it will be shutting down its
            manufacturing operations in Nelson Mandela Bay, a move that the
            workers' union NUMSA has described as a serious blow to jobs in the
            Eastern Cape.
          </p>
          <p>
            The factory, which has been running since 1947, currently employs
            around 900 people directly. It also supports many more jobs through
            services linked to the plant, such as catering, security, transport,
            and maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This closure is part of a bigger restructuring effort across
            Goodyear's Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, as the
            company adapts to changing market demands and reshapes its business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Goodyear will still have a sales and distribution presence
            in South Africa and continue operating its Hi-Q retail stores, it
            will no longer manufacture tyres locally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Goodyear South Africa is part of the global Goodyear Tyre & Rubber
            Holdings and plays a role in the company's Emerging Markets group.
            It has been known for producing a wide range of tyres for everything
            from cars and SUVs to trucks, off-road vehicles, and even airplanes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company's decision kicks off a formal restructuring process,
            following the rules of South Africa's Labour Relations Act. The
            Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA) will
            help manage the process. Goodyear has said it is committed to
            treating affected workers fairly and providing support during this
            difficult transition.
