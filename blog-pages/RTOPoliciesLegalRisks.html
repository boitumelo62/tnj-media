          <p>
            More and more businesses in South Africa are ending their
            work-from-home (WFH) policies and requiring employees to return to
            the office. But legal experts are warning companies to be careful
            because pushing a return to office (RTO) order without following the
            right process could land them in legal trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Labour Court has already made it clear, employers cannot simply
            force employees back to the office without proper consultation. And
            they definitely can't use RTO orders as a reason to punish or fire
            workers who don't comply especially if those employees had valid
            remote work agreements in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to legal experts from the law firm Bowmans, recent Labour
            Court rulings have reinforced that RTO instructions must be
            reasonable and employers should engage with staff before making any
            changes. This means giving employees a chance to understand the
            company's reasoning and to raise their concerns. That kind of
            process not only builds trust but also helps avoid claims of unfair
            treatment later on.
          </p>
          <p>
            One recent case in May 2025 illustrates the risks. An employee who
            had been working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic due to
            health reasons was instructed to return to the office once the
            situation began to improve. When she didn't comply, the company
            launched a disciplinary process and dismissed her for gross
            misconduct.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the employee challenged the dismissal, and both the Labour
            Court and the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration
            (CCMA) found that her firing was unfair both in terms of the reasons
            given and the process followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This case shows that employers can't simply reverse WFH agreements
            at will. Once a remote work arrangement has been negotiated, it
            becomes part of the working conditions and changing it requires a
            fair process. If not handled properly, enforcing a return to the
            office could expose companies to legal challenges and reputational
            damage.
