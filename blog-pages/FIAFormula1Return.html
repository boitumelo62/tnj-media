          />
          <p>
            South Africa's historic Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit has taken a
            monumental step toward re claiming its place on the global
            motorsport stage. The FIA has officially approved upgrade plans that
            would elevate the circuit from its current Grade 2 status to all
            important Grade 1—making it eligible to host Formula 1 races once
            again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only Grade 1 circuits meet the safety, infrastructure, and facility
            standards mandated by Formula 1. With the FIA's sign off on final
            design proposals, Kyalami now has a three year window to complete
            enhancements such as advanced run off zones, high grade barriers,
            reinforced debris fencing, re engineered kerbs, and upgraded
            drainage systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            These upgrades are described by Apex Circuit Design's founder Clive
            Bowen—who also designed Miami International Autodrome—as a “light
            touch” approach. There will be no changes to the existing circuit
            layout, preserving Kyalami's legendary character and flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Estimated to cost around $10 million (roughly R180-200 million), the
            project reflects a strategic, phased execution plan aimed at
            minimizing disruption to ongoing events held at the venue. Circuit
            owner Toby Venter, who purchased Kyalami in 2014, described the
            approval as “a defining moment for South African motorsport” and
            marks “a bold new chapter” toward bringing back the roar of F1
            engines to African soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            If successfully upgraded and selected by Formula 1 management,
            Kyalami would become the only Grade 1 circuit on the entire African
            continent. It's part of South Africa's bid, with competing venues
            emerging (e.g., Cape Town Street circuit), to host a return F1 Grand
            Prix in the post 2026 era.
          </p>
          <p>
            The African continent hasn't seen a Formula 1 race since 1993, when
            the final South African GP was held at Kyalami. Recent efforts by
            figures like Lewis Hamilton and discussions with African nations
            such as Rwanda and Morocco highlight the growing momentum to re
            introduce F1 to this passionate region.
          </p>
          <h3>Timeline & Next Moves</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>2014: </strong>Toby Venter acquires Kyalami, begins push
              for revival
            </li>
            <li><strong>2016: </strong>Venue upgraded to Grade 2</li>
            <li>
              <strong>2025: </strong>FIA approves Grade 1 design; three year
              timeline begins
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2026-2028: </strong>Potential completion window; pending
              F1 calendar inclusion
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Final construction will be staged to avoid conflicts with current
            events, with some works contingent upon South Africa securing an F1
            slot and Kyalami being chosen as the hosting venue
          </p>
