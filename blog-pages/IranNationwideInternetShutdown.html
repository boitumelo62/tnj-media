          <p>
            Tehran, 19 June 2025 — The Iranian government has implemented a
            widespread internet blackout across the country, significantly
            limiting access to global websites and online services. The move
            comes amid rising tensions with Israel and concerns over
            cyberattacks targeting Iranian infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shutdown began on 13 June and has since escalated into one of
            the most severe internet restrictions the country has imposed in
            recent years. By 18 June, connectivity had dropped to less than 5%
            of normal traffic, according to international internet monitoring
            agencies. While Iran's domestic intranet system—the National
            Information Network (NIN)—remains operational, access to
            international platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, and app
            stores has been effectively blocked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Government officials claim the restrictions are a temporary national
            security measure aimed at preventing foreign interference and cyber
            threats, particularly from Israel. However, rights groups and
            digital watchdogs argue that the blackout serves a dual purpose:
            shielding the government from international scrutiny and suppressing
            domestic dissent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shutdown has disrupted critical sectors, including banking,
            commerce, and communications. Major banks have reported outages, and
            popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Nobitex have faced
            connectivity issues. Citizens have also struggled to access
            emergency information and news from outside the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an attempt to bypass restrictions, SpaceX's Starlink satellite
            internet service has reportedly been activated over Iran, offering
            limited access to uncensored information for journalists, activists,
            and select users. The Iranian government has responded by warning
            against unauthorized internet access and urging the public to delete
            WhatsApp, alleging it may be compromised by foreign
            intelligence—claims denied by the platform's parent company, Meta.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iran has a history of cutting internet access during periods of
            unrest, including during mass protests in 2019 and 2022. This latest
            blackout, however, is broader in scope and linked directly to
            escalating geopolitical conflict, rather than internal
            demonstrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of now, the government has provided no clear timeline for the
            restoration of full internet access. Analysts warn the shutdown
            could last several more days or weeks, deepening Iran's digital
            isolation at a time of heightened regional instability.
