            Lanseria takes on OR Tambo with Massive Infrastructure Overhaul
          </h2>
          <p>
            Lanseria International Airport, South Africa’s only privately owned
            and operated airport, is preparing for some big changes. Located in
            Gauteng, the airport is laying the foundation for a major upgrade
            aimed at increasing capacity, improving services, and becoming a key
            player in regional air travel, especially within the Southern
            African Development Community and the broader sub Saharan region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, Lanseria is the fourth busiest airport in the country,
            with about 1.9 million passengers passing through each year. That
            number is expected to more than double to over four million by 2032
            and reach six million by 2037. Long term, they’re aiming for a
            massive 18 million passengers by 2050. To support this growth, the
            airport is launching a large infrastructure expansion. This includes
            adding more terminal space, increasing parking, relocating fuel and
            technical facilities, and upgrading critical parts of the airport’s
            structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the more immediate concerns they’re addressing is the high
            cost of long-term parking, which has been a regular complaint.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response, Lanseria is building a three storey parking garage
            right across from the terminal. It’s costing them R250 million and
            will add 1,000 parking bays, bringing the total to 4,000. The
            airport is banking on its ease of access and convenience as major
            selling points. According to CEO Rampa Rammopo, it’s quick and
            simple to get from the plane to your car, and the airport avoids the
            chaos of a large retail space, focusing instead on efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further ahead, they’re considering building a second runway, which
            could cost between R1 billion and R2 billion. Plans are also well
            underway for a new cargo precinct, aimed at making Lanseria a key
            logistics hub in the region. This cargo project is being rolled out
            over ten years, with construction starting in the third quarter of
            2025. It’s a response to the lessons learned during the COVID-19
            pandemic when passenger travel dropped sharply and the need to
            diversify became clear. The hope is that it will drive business
            growth and improve logistics across the region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lanseria is also making use of its available land. The airport owns
            about 90 hectares of undeveloped property and has just signed its
            first lease agreement with Bionic Aviation, which will be building a
            cutting-edge hangar and office complex using around 2,000 square
            metres of space. On top of that, the airport is in the middle of a
            five year plan to refurbish its hangars, with six already completed.
            They're also working on digitising systems, enhancing security, and
            upgrading service delivery to make life easier for operators and
            increase returns on investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the other major upgrades in the pipeline is the
            rehabilitation of Alpha Taxiway, a key section of the airport built
            more than 20 years ago. This is meant to extend its lifespan,
            improve how efficiently aircraft move on the ground, and maintain
            the airport’s high safety standards. Construction for this is
            expected to start in early 2026 after all the planning and
            feasibility studies are wrapped up. To prepare for the expected
            increase in traffic, Lanseria is also expanding its fuel storage.
            Currently, it holds about 1,000 cubic metres of fuel, but that will
            grow to 6,000 cubic metres. This increase should help prevent supply
            issues and make sure airlines can count on the airport to meet their
            needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all these developments, Rammopo says Lanseria isn’t just trying
            to offer an alternative to OR Tambo International Airport — it wants
            to compete directly and be seen as a major player in South African
            and regional aviation.
