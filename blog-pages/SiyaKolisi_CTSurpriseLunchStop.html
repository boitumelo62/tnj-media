          <p>
            Springbok captain Siya Kolisi caused a buzz in Cape Town this
            afternoon when he popped into a local eatery for a quick takeaway
            and fans couldn't get enough of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kolisi stopped by New York Bagel, a popular spot in the eastern part
            of the city, and was met with cheers, applause, and even ululating
            from excited diners. One onlooker said, “People were so excited to
            see him. It was such a moment! He's so humble truly a hero.”
          </p>
          <p>
            While waiting to place his order, Kolisi asked the crowd for
            suggestions. One person recommended the chicken-schnitzel bagel, and
            he went with that plus a bagel dog for good measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Springboks are in town this week as they prepare for the much
            anticipated Qatar Airways Cup match on Saturday, where they'll take
            on the Barbarians for the first time ever on South African soil.
            With Kolisi in the city for training, fans might catch more
            unexpected sightings around Cape Town.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just a day before his bagel stop, Kolisi posted TikTok videos from
            Johannesburg, where he was enjoying a traditional African meal with
            fellow Sharks player Aphelele Fassi at Sakhumzi restaurant in Zoo
            Lake. “I'm in Jozi. I needed some proper African food. I just want
            to go home trotters, veggies, and samp,” Kolisi says in the video.
            Fassi, for his part, was tucking into samp and tripe.
          </p>
          <p>One fan commented: “You are everywhere, my Captain!”</p>
          <p>
            Kolisi's ties to Cape Town go beyond rugby. His children live in the
            city with his ex-wife Rachel, and he's often spotted around town
            when visiting them. Even during the December holidays, while Rachel
            and the kids were overseas, Kolisi spent time in Cape Town fueling
            past rumours that he might move back to join the Stormers.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, he remains firmly committed to the Sharks. Wherever he
            goes, one thing's clear: Siya Kolisi brings joy and pride to South
            Africans just by being himself.
