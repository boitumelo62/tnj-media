          <h2>Reinet Moves Closer to Major PIC Deal</h2>
          <p>
            Reinet Investments, led by Johann Rupert as executive chairman, has
            spoken out about the potential sale of its largest asset, the
            UK-based Pension Insurance Corporation Group (PIC). PIC is Reinet's
            most valuable holding, making up over half of the company's total
            assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reinet indirectly owns a 49.5% stake in PIC, which specializes in
            managing pension funds through secure and socially responsible
            investments. As of the end of 2024, PIC oversaw £50.9 billion
            (around R1.2 trillion) in assets and managed pensions for nearly
            400,000 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            After recent media reports raised questions about a possible sale,
            Reinet confirmed that talks are well advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Athora Holdings, a company that provides retirement and insurance
            services, is negotiating to potentially buy 100% of PIC. The
            proposed deal values PIC at £5.7 billion (R135 billion), which is
            higher than previous estimates of up to £5 billion (R120 billion).
            However, Reinet made it clear that nothing is final yet. There's no
            guarantee that the deal will go through, and the company promised to
            update shareholders if and when anything becomes official.
          </p>
          <p>
            This potential sale would be Reinet's second major move in recent
            months. At the end of 2024 and into early 2025, the company sold its
            stake in British American Tobacco (BAT), a decision that
            significantly boosted its cash reserves. Reinet now holds €1.8
            billion (R37 billion) in cash and liquid assets — a big jump from
            just 5.7% of its portfolio a year ago to 26.3% now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Johann Rupert highlighted in the company's latest financial results
            that this strong cash position puts Reinet in a solid place to fund
            current and future investments. It also strengthens the broader
            Rupert business empire, which includes major holdings in Remgro and
            luxury group Richemont.
