          <p>
            Just days after the South African government lifted part of a ban on
            chicken imports from Brazil, the situation has taken a turn for the
            worse and meat producers are growing increasingly worried. The
            Department of Agriculture had announced in mid-June that it would
            ease the restrictions imposed in May 2025 after an outbreak of bird
            flu (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI) in Brazil.
          </p>
          <p>
            This raised hopes that the country would soon start receiving
            mechanically deboned meat (MDM), a key ingredient used to make
            popular, low-cost protein foods like polony, viennas, Russians, meat
            pies, and burgers.However, those hopes have quickly faded.According
            to the South African Meat Processors Association (SAMPA), Brazil and
            South Africa have reached a deadlock in negotiations over the import
            health certificate a technical document required to resume the
            trade. Brazil has reportedly rejected the proposed wording of the
            certificate, meaning the ban is effectively still in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            This ongoing stalemate has left meat processors in a tight spot. MDM
            stockpiles have already been running low for weeks, and many
            factories are now out of raw material altogether. Some companies
            have even started laying off workers as production grinds to a
            halt.“South Africa does not produce MDM in any meaningful amount,”
            SAMPA explained. “We rely almost entirely on imports and 95% of that
            has come from Brazil over the past 12 years.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The shortage couldn't come at a worse time. Alongside the MDM
            crisis, South Africa is also facing a major hit to beef supply due
            to a recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreak at the country's biggest
            feedlot. On top of that, one of the major poultry producers,
            DayBreak Foods, has collapsed adding more pressure to an already
            fragile food system. The result? Meat prices are on the rise, and
            food security is at serious risk especially for lower income
            households that depend on processed meats for affordable protein.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stats SA's inflation data for May already showed meat prices
            starting to climb, and industry experts say it's only going to get
            worse unless the impasse with Brazil is resolved soon. SAMPA and
            other companies, including Eskort, have warned the government that
            the crisis is threatening not just food supplies and prices, but
            also jobs. The meat processing industry employs more than 125,000
            people across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            The association is urging both governments to urgently find a
            solution before the situation worsens.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Without immediate action, we're looking at more food shortages,
            higher prices, job losses, and business closures,” SAMPA warned.
