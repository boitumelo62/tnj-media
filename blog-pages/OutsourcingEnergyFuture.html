          />
          <p>
            South Africa is trying to shift away from coal and move toward
            cleaner, fairer energy solutions a process known as the Just Energy
            Transition (JET). The idea is to cut carbon emissions while also
            protecting the rights and livelihoods of workers and communities
            affected by this shift. But a new investigation is raising serious
            concerns about where the money meant to fund this transition is
            actually going.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 26 June 2025, a civil society group called Open Secrets released
            a report titled The Climate Consultants. It shows that a large chunk
            of the international funding South Africa has received for its
            energy transition isn't being used to support local efforts, but is
            instead flowing into the pockets of global consulting firms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of these firms are based in the very countries that are
            donating the money countries that are publicly supporting South
            Africa's transition but, behind the scenes, benefiting financially
            from it. South Africa's own estimates say that the transition will
            cost around $100 billion (or R1.76 trillion). So far, international
            partners have pledged roughly $12.8 billion (R225.69 billion), but
            only a small portion about 6% comes in the form of grants. That
            means most of the money is either loans or investments with strings
            attached.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report reveals that nearly two-thirds of the grant money has
            been directed toward private companies and foreign institutions not
            to local non-profits, universities, or public agencies that are
            closer to the ground and more likely to understand local needs. This
            is deeply concerning to the people behind the report, especially as
            South Africa becomes the first Global South country to formally
            partner with international donors on such a large scale for climate
            transition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michael Marchant from Open Secrets, who co-authored the report,
            warned that consultants now play a powerful role in shaping national
            energy policies. But these firms aren't acting out of public
            interest. They're businesses, driven by profit. He argued that
            relying so heavily on outside consultants especially ones who aren't
            transparent about their work threatens democracy. It reduces the
            state's ability to build its own expertise and makes it easier for
            corporations, some with links to the fossil fuel industry, to
            influence public policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report also points to clear conflicts of interest. Some of these
            firms advise both the government and big fossil fuel companies.
            Despite this, they've been hired to help steer South Africa's
            response to climate change and the energy crisis. Their growing
            power is often unchecked and rarely questioned, even though some of
            them have been linked to past corruption and scandals, both in South
            Africa and abroad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zen Mathe, another investigator at Open Secrets, highlighted that
            this is especially troubling in a country still grappling with the
            fallout of state capture. She said that allowing these firms to
            dominate such an important space without strict oversight is
            dangerous especially since they haven't always been held accountable
            for their actions in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open Secrets believes the public deserves to know more about how
            these consultants are influencing critical decisions around energy,
            climate, and economic reform. The group is calling for greater
            transparency and accountability. They say it's time to question
            whether these firms should have so much control over policies that
            affect everyone, and to ensure that South Africa's energy transition
            remains fair, inclusive, and truly serves the public good.
