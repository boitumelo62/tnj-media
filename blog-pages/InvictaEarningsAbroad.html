          />
          <p>
            Invicta Holdings, led by billionaire Christo Wiese, is planning to
            generate at least half of its income from outside South Africa
            within the next two years. The company outlined this strategic goal
            in its financial results for the year ending March 2025, pointing to
            a tough operating environment at home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Challenges such as unreliable electricity, inadequate
            infrastructure, regulatory delays, and ongoing political and
            economic uncertainty have pushed Invicta to diversify its income
            sources geographically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wiese, known for building Shoprite and Pep into household names,
            said that geographic diversification and sustainable earnings are
            central to Invicta's long-term strategy. He emphasized that the
            company's core business — supplying parts, components, and
            consumables — remains essential to economic activity, regardless of
            market conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invicta has made several moves to expand its global presence. In the
            United States, the company launched a new start-up, KSP, through its
            joint venture with Kian Ann Engineering. This new operation aims to
            grow Invicta's distribution of undercarriage machinery and
            complements its existing American business, KTSU. In the United
            Kingdom, Invicta acquired Nationwide Bearing Company to further
            strengthen its European footprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of its broader restructuring, Invicta sold its entire stake
            in KMP Holdings to its joint venture partner Kian Ann, and relocated
            a Singapore-based distribution center to China. Wiese said the sale
            aligned offshore operations while allowing Invicta to retain an
            interest in KMP's future performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deal resulted in a once-off profit of R222 million, which
            contributed significantly to a 57% jump in basic earnings per share
            from 492 cents to 773 cents. Revenue increased by 6% to R8.11
            billion, while operating profit before foreign exchange movements
            rose 21% to R765.43 million. Net asset value per share also grew by
            13% to 5,931 cents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past year, the company redeemed nearly 7 million preference
            shares and repurchased 4.9 million ordinary shares as part of its
            efforts to improve shareholder value. While Invicta continues to
            expand globally, it remains alert to domestic risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company noted that the formation of South Africa's Government of
            National Unity had lifted market confidence, resulting in stronger
            performance in the latter part of the year. However, it warned that
            long-term structural challenges remain, including political
            instability, labour unrest, and the deindustrialisation of the South
            African economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            One particular concern is the closure of major steelmaking
            operations in 2025, which the company believes could severely impact
            the country's industrial base.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invicta also cautioned that government efforts to protect local
            industries could backfire by increasing inefficiencies and weakening
            competitiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these headwinds, Wiese remains confident in the group's
            direction. He credited the company's solid performance to
            operational discipline and the ability to adapt strategically, even
            in difficult markets.
