            Samsung has announced a new software update to introduce new
            features to its Bespoke AI series refrigerators. This update will
            bring Bixby improvements, allowing it to offer a customized user
            experience based on voice recognition. It will also bring Samsung TV
            Plus to Bespoke AI refrigerators with AI Home screens in more
            countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Samsung announced that it will soon release a new software
            update to its Bespoke AI refrigerators with Family Hub screens and
            AI Home screens. The update, which comes to Bespoke AI refrigerators
            with Family Hub screens in the first quarter of this year,
            introduces Bixby's Voice ID feature that lets refrigerators identify
            a person via their voice and offer them a customized experience.
            Bixby is a virtual assistant developed by Samsung. It's designed to
            simplify interactions with your Samsung device, allowing you to
            control various functions, from opening apps to setting alarms,
            using voice commands or a dedicated Bixby button. Bixby learns and
            adapts to your preferences, offering a personalized experience as
            you use it more.

            Bixby uses voice recognition to detect which family member is
            currently using the refrigerator, and then automatically switches to
            the associated user account. For this feature to work, the user's
            voice needs to be registered with their Samsung Account on the
            refrigerator or on their own Galaxy smartphone or tablet.
