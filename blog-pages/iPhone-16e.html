            The release of the iPhone 16E has seen it become one of Apple&#39;s
            most affordable iPhones, sharing many features with its original
            counterpart, iPhone 16. However, there are also some shortages you
            will encounter for the discounted model.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's safe to say a few core components like the A18 chip, iOS 18 and
            Apple Intelligence are the same for both devices, there are notable
            differences across the phones&#39; hardware, such as cameras,
            designs and batteries. Take a look at all the "need to know specs"
            for the more budget-friendly iPhone 16E, in comparison to the
            baseline iPhone 16.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although both phones have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz
            refresh rate, the 16E has a peak brightness of 1,200 nits while the
            16 reaches 2,000 nits, with a ceramic shield front and glass back
            are featured on each phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both devices boast an aluminium design and are about as heavy as
            each other, with the iPhone 16E weighing in at 167 grams and the
            iPhone 16 at 170 grams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only the iPhone 16 has a camera control button, both phones also
            have an Action button. The Dynamic Island feature is also limited to
            the pricier model, however both devices each have an IP68 rating for
            dust and water resistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time Apple has opted to bring back the home button in favour of
            face ID on its new budget phone, after it was removed from major
            iPhone variants on the iPhone X in 2017. Both devices also have a
            USB-C port, and neither has a headphone jack. The iPhone 16E comes
            in black and white, while the iPhone 16 comes in black, white, pink,
            teal and ultramarine.
          </p>
          <p>
            One will find a 48-megapixel wide camera on both the iPhone 16E and
            iPhone 16, as well as a 12- megapixel ultrawide camera on the 16.
            You can shoot 4K video at 60 frames per second on each device. On
            the iPhone 16, you can shoot 1080p spatial video, but only at 30
            frames per second.
          </p>
          <p>
            The iPhone 16E is available in South Africa, and is priced from
            R15,999 for the base 128GB model. Customers can also take advantage
            of trade-in offers, receiving up to R22,000 cash back when trading
            in their existing devices. This cash back is deposited directly into
            customers&#39; bank accounts within 30 days after purchasing the
            iPhone 16e.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, iStore provides a free iCarePlus package valued at
            R1,999 with every iPhone 16e purchase. This package includes an
            extended warranty, screen repair services, and a guaranteed buy-back
            option, ensuring that customers can trade in their iPhone for at
            least 55% of its original value two years from now.
