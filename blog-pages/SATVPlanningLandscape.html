          <p>
            Over the next two years, South Africa's TV planning landscape is set
            for two major shifts one in 2026 and a much more transformative one
            in 2027.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting in the first quarter of 2026, the new TAMS (Television
            Audience Measurement Survey) universe will go live. This change is
            based on a new Establishment Survey (ES) being conducted during
            2025. While this update might seem relatively minor, it's still
            significant because the current panel setup relies on outdated data
            PAMS 2019 for the panel and 2020 figures for pay-TV subscribers.
            Since then, the TV environment in South Africa has changed
            considerably, with how people access and consume TV content becoming
            much more complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ask Africa has been appointed to run this crucial research, and once
            complete, it will give us a more accurate picture of the current TV
            landscape. However, we won't fully grasp the impact of these changes
            until the new universe data is used in planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            This transition won't be seamless. There will be a period where old
            and new data sets overlap where planning might be based on outdated
            figures, while performance results reflect the updated data. During
            this time, marketers, agencies, and broadcasters will need to be
            flexible with deliverables, cost-per-point deals, and performance
            targets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, in 2027, an even more dramatic change is coming: the
            introduction of Total Video Measurement (TVM). This will redefine
            how TV and video audiences are measured in South Africa. The idea is
            to create a single system that captures audience behaviour across
            every type of video platform live TV, catch-up viewing (BVOD),
            streaming services (OTT), social media, mobile, and even out-of-home
            viewing.
          </p>
          <p>
            TVM isn't just about collecting more data. It's about creating a
            trusted, standardised framework that broadcasters, advertisers, and
            agencies can use for planning, trading, and evaluating content. It's
            being designed to meet international standards while being flexible
            enough to deal with uniquely South African challenges like
            electricity blackouts, uneven internet access, and a mix of urban
            and rural viewing habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once this new system is up and running, software providers like
            Arianna and Transmit will also need to evolve. These tools were
            designed for the existing local market, and they'll need significant
            updates to handle the complexity of TVM data. In fact, international
            planning tools often look and function very differently, reflecting
            the more trade-focused nature of global markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help everyone adjust, the plan is to run both the old and new
            systems in parallel for a while. This should give broadcasters,
            agencies, and marketers time to learn, compare, and make sense of
            the changes before any new performance benchmarks are set in stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's understandable that this all might feel overwhelming. But these
            changes are both necessary and overdue. South Africa's media
            environment is evolving rapidly, and these steps will finally bring
            measurement and planning up to speed with how people actually watch
            video today across all screens, all platforms, and all times of day.
