          <p>
            South Africa's newly formed Government of National Unity (GNU) is
            showing cautious but promising progress as it settles into power
            following the country's most closely contested general election
            since 1994. The election, which left no single party with a
            majority, led to a historic coalition between the African National
            Congress (ANC), Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha Freedom Party
            (IFP), and several smaller parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            President Cyril Ramaphosa, who retained his position as head of
            state, has called the GNU a “new chapter of inclusive governance”
            aimed at rebuilding public trust, stabilizing the economy, and
            delivering basic services more effectively. The Cabinet, formed
            earlier this month, reflects the coalition's shared governance, with
            key ministries divided between parties. The DA now leads portfolios
            such as public service and trade, while the IFP has been assigned
            traditional affairs and rural development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parliament has resumed under Speaker Annelie Lotriet (DA), elected
            through a joint agreement among GNU partners. Committees are working
            to align on policy goals for the second half of 2025, with an
            emphasis on improving infrastructure, reducing corruption, and
            boosting investor confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Economically, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana unveiled a revised
            budget policy focused on fiscal responsibility, green energy
            development, and support for small businesses. The rand has shown
            moderate stability, and credit rating agencies have maintained South
            Africa's outlook as neutral, citing the potential of a functioning
            multi-party government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Public response has been mixed. Some South Africans are hopeful that
            shared power could bring greater accountability, while others remain
            skeptical about how the coalition will handle long-standing
            challenges like load-shedding, unemployment, and crime. “I'm tired
            of promises. We need real change, not more talk,” said Soweto
            resident Mpho Radebe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Policy friction has already surfaced over issues like land reform,
            economic empowerment, and foreign relations, particularly regarding
            Israel and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Analysts warn that
            ideological divisions could threaten unity if not carefully managed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, political experts say the GNU represents a significant moment
            in South African democracy. “It's an opportunity to reset the
            country's direction through compromise and shared accountability,”
            said political analyst Lebo Makhubela. “But it will only work if the
            focus stays on delivery, not political survival.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The GNU has committed to showing tangible results within its first
            100 days—a promise many are watching closely. Whether this
            experiment in coalition politics delivers lasting change remains
            uncertain, but for now, the country stands at a critical turning
            point.
