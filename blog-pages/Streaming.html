          <p>
            As global streaming growth slows, Africa is stepping into the
            spotlight. With its young, mobile- first population and growing
            demand for digital content, the continent is becoming a key focus
            for platforms looking to scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            In South Africa alone, over 8.4 million people now use paid or
            subscription-based streaming services. And the market is still
            growing fast, with projections pointing to an 8% annual growth rate
            through 2028
          </p>
          <p>
            But what works elsewhere won't necessarily work here. Africa isn't
            one market, it's many each with its own realities. In places like
            South Africa, users jump between mobile data and Wi-Fi, want
            flexible pricing, and expect content in their own languages. To
            succeed, platforms must build from the ground up with local habits,
            culture and constraints in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cost is a major factor. Many users are price-sensitive and practical
            they want value, not just entertainment. That's why hybrid models
            that mix free, ad-supported content with paid upgrades are gaining
            traction. Short-term or low-cost options like daily subscriptions
            are key
          </p>
          <p>
            Data costs also matter. Telco partnerships that offer data-inclusive
            bundles or zero rated content make a big difference. At Viu, for
            example, working with mobile networks has helped lower the barriers
            for many South Africans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Free, ad-supported streaming isn't just a stop gap , it's a smart
            and scalable way to grow. It brings in new users and gives
            advertisers access to a mobile-first, highly engaged audience. But
            ads need to reflect local languages, cultural cues and values to
            really land.
          </p>
          <p>
            These aren't passive consumers. They're young, brand-aware and
            intentional. Platforms and advertisers that show up authentically
            will win their attention and loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Africa's audience is ready. Infrastructure is improving, smartphones
            are everywhere, and cultural pride is rising. But the content must
            reflect real African lives in local languages, across genres, and
            made by local creators.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is more than entertainment. It's about economic opportunity,
            creative ownership and cultural influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Africa isn't playing catch-up. It's building its own streaming
            future, mobile first grounded in local relevance, and shaped by how
            people actually live
