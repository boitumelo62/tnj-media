            Upon its release, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge hoped to revitalize
            the mobile market and open the gates to a new revenue stream, for
            both Samsung and the entire industry. However, the dream is
            seemingly beginning to turn into a nightmare with the phone
            seemingly failing to measure up to Samsung&#39;s original vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to industry sources, the Galaxy S25 Edge sales are below
            expectations as the phone doesn&#39;t seem to have attracted a large
            enough crowd to satisfy the Korean tech giant. It might be
            dangerously close to becoming an ambitious experiment that failed to
            post the expected results.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this is true, what could have gone wrong? That will be something
            to debate once we have more data. Nevertheless, we have already
            noticed a

              >couple of early signs</a
            >
            that the Galaxy S25 Edge might not be the hot item Samsung had hoped
            for.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, pre-order bonuses in some markets got better every few days.
            Although that sounded like good news to any prospective buyers, it
            also signaled that early pre-order figures, at least in those
            markets, may have been very low. Low enough to have forced Samsung
            to sweeten its pre-order bonuses within the first two weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, upon launching the Galaxy S25 Edge in Korea following the
            pre-order period, Samsung didn&#39;t reveal any early sales figures
            recorded in its home market. This isn&#39;t a hard confirmation of
            bad sales, but for Samsung, it is odd. There may have been nothing
            to brag about.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all fairness, the story of the Galaxy S25 Edge has only begun,
            and people may not have yet warmed up to the concept. It&#39;s not
            over yet, and who knows?! Maybe things will pick up under the right
            circumstances. Samsung&#39;s generous discount strategies can often
            turn things around for almost any device.
